### **Islam and Psychology**

[p. 399]

**In the name of Allah, the Entirely Merciful, the Especially Merciful**

[p. 400]

### **Islam and Psychology**

This universe operates according to thoughts, intentions, and will, and every step a person takes is psychologically based on some form of hope or fear.

The word "psychology" (*nafsiyat*) is derived from the word ***Nafs***. By its fundamental nature, the human *Nafs* (the self or psyche) is always inclined towards evil. Allah the Most Generous states:

> **إِنَّ النَّفْسَ لَأَمَّارَةٌ بِالسُّوءِ**
>
> *"Indeed, the soul is a persistent enjoiner of evil."*
> — Quran, 12:53

When the state of the *Nafs* improves, it is called the ***Nafs al-Lawwamah*** (the self-reproaching soul) (Quran, 75:2), meaning the soul that regrets after making a mistake. Then, when the *Nafs* completely abandons evil, it is called the ***Nafs al-Mutma'innah*** (the soul at peace) (Quran, 89:27), meaning the soul that is content in righteousness.

In worldly matters, the fundamental cure for psychological difficulties and the key to success lie in the **creed of monotheism (*Tawhid*)** and **trust in Allah (*Tawakkul*)**. When a person becomes hopeless with all material means, they begin to wait for some form of unseen help. It is about this very cry of the desperate that Allah the Most Generous says:

> **أَمَّن يُجِيبُ الْمُضْطَرَّ إِذَا دَعَاهُ وَيَكْشِفُ السُّوءَ وَيَجْعَلُكُمْ خُلَفَاءَ الْأَرْضِ ۗ أَإِلَٰهٌ مَّعَ اللَّهِ ۚ قَلِيلًا مَّا تَذَكَّرُونَ**
>
> *"Is He [not best] who responds to the desperate one when he calls upon Him and removes the evil and makes you successors of the earth? Is there a deity with Allah? Little do you remember."*
> — Quran, 27:62

**Translation:** Who is it that answers the cry of the desperate when he calls Him, and who is it that removes the hardship? And who is it that appoints you as successors after death? Is there any god besides Allah? You think so little.

This is why Islam lays the foundation of human success on the principle of *La ilaha illa Allah* (there is no god but Allah) long before one reaches a state of desperation. This is the teaching that all the Prophets (peace be upon them) continued to give (Quran, 21:25).

It is narrated from Ibn Abbas (may Allah be pleased with him) that he said: I was behind the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him and his family) one day, and he said:

> **يَا غُلَامُ... احْفَظِ اللَّهَ يَحْفَظْكَ، احْفَظِ اللَّهَ تَجِدْهُ تُجَاهَكَ،**
>
> *"O young man... Be mindful of Allah, and Allah will protect you. Be mindful of Allah, and you will find Him in front of you."*

[p. 401]

> **...وَإِذَا سَأَلْتَ فَاسْأَلِ اللَّهَ، وَإِذَا اسْتَعَنْتَ فَاسْتَعِنْ بِاللَّهِ، وَاعْلَمْ أَنَّ الْأُمَّةَ لَوِ اجْتَمَعَتْ عَلَى أَنْ يَنْفَعُوكَ بِشَيْءٍ لَمْ يَنْفَعُوكَ إِلَّا بِشَيْءٍ قَدْ كَتَبَهُ اللَّهُ لَكَ، وَلَوِ اجْتَمَعُوا عَلَى أَنْ يَضُرُّوكَ بِشَيْءٍ لَمْ يَضُرُّوكَ إِلَّا بِشَيْءٍ قَدْ كَتَبَ اللَّهُ عَلَيْكَ، رُفِعَتِ الْأَقْلَامُ وَجَفَّتِ الصُّحُفُ**
>
> *"If you ask, ask of Allah; if you seek help, seek help from Allah. Know that if the nations were to gather together to benefit you with something, they would not benefit you except with what Allah has decreed for you. And if they were to gather together to harm you with something, they would not harm you except with what Allah has decreed for you. The pens have been lifted and the pages have dried."*
> — Tirmidhi, Hadith 2516; Musnad Ahmad, Hadith 2673

**Translation:** Hazrat Ibn Abbas (may Allah be pleased with him) says that one day I was riding behind the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings be upon him). He (peace be upon him) said: "O young man! Be mindful of Allah, and He will be mindful of you. Be mindful of Allah, and you will find Him before you. When you ask, ask from Allah; when you seek help, seek help from Allah. And know that if all the people were to unite to benefit you, they could not benefit you in any way except that which Allah has written for you. And if all the people were to unite to harm you, they could not harm you in any way except that which Allah has written for you. The pens have been lifted, and the ink has dried."

The secret to success in the path of religion lies in the soundness of one's creed, along with subduing the *Nafs* and remembering the Hereafter. The Noble Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him) said:

> **الْكَيِّسُ مَنْ دَانَ نَفْسَهُ وَعَمِلَ لِمَا بَعْدَ الْمَوْتِ**
>
> *"The wise one is he who holds himself accountable and works for what is after death."*
> — Tirmidhi, Hadith 2459; Ibn Majah, Hadith 4260

The people of Islam have written so many books on the subjects of ethics (*akhlaq*) and spiritual purification (*tasawwuf*) that the entire world cannot compete with them. Both of these subjects are related to psychology, even if the terms ethics, manners, or *tasawwuf* are used.

### **The Psychology of Children**

The level of intelligence and God-given ability (IQ), the child's innate nature, and the child's upbringing—in all of this, the role of the parents and the environment are fundamental. A child imitates his parents and their character plays a pivotal role in the construction of his personality. The child's own individual effort comes much later. His mind is like a blank slate; whatever is written on it is difficult to erase. Childhood habits are very difficult to change in adulthood.

[p. 402]

Allama al-Busiri (may Allah have mercy on him) writes:

> **النَّفْسُ كَالطِّفْلِ إِنْ تُهْمِلْهُ شَبَّ عَلَى**
> **حُبِّ الرَّضَاعِ وَإِنْ تَفْطِمْهُ يَنْفَطِمِ**
>
> *"The soul is like an infant; if you let it, it will grow up loving to suckle, but if you wean it, it will be weaned."*

**Translation:** A person's *Nafs* is like a child; as long as you keep feeding it milk, it will continue to drink, and when you wean it, it will stop.

The Noble Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him) showed great affection to children. Once, he visited the home of the princess, Sayyidah Fatimah al-Zahra (may Allah be pleased with her), and asked about Sayyiduna Imam Hassan, "Where is the little one (*Luka'*)?" (Bukhari, Hadith 5884).

He (peace and blessings be upon him) would take the initiative in greeting children. It is in a hadith:

> **عَنْ أَنَسِ بْنِ مَالِكٍ رَضِيَ اللَّهُ عَنْهُ، أَنَّهُ مَرَّ عَلَى صِبْيَانٍ فَسَلَّمَ عَلَيْهِمْ، وَقَالَ كَانَ النَّبِيُّ صلى الله عليه وسلم يَفْعَلُهُ**
>
> *Anas bin Malik (may Allah be pleased with him) passed by some children and greeted them, and he said, "The Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him) used to do so."*
> — Bukhari, 6247; Muslim, 2168

Hazrat Anas ibn Malik (may Allah be pleased with him) says: The Noble Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him) once passed by some children and greeted them. He (peace and blessings be upon him) used to do this.

He would lift the two noble Hassans (Hassan and Hussein, may Allah be pleased with them) onto his blessed back (Tirmidhi, 3769). He would start playing with them.

He would seat Hazrat Usama ibn Zayd (may Allah be pleased with him) on one thigh and Hazrat Imam Hassan (may Allah be pleased with him) on the other, then hold them close and say: "O Allah, have mercy on both of them, for I am merciful to them" (Bukhari, Hadith 6003).

Hazrat Usama ibn Zayd (may Allah be pleased with him) was young, and the Noble Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him) moved forward to clean his nose, but the Mother of the Believers, Sayyidah Aisha al-Siddiqah (may Allah be pleased with her), did it first (Tirmidhi, Hadith 3818).

[p. 403]

He would also engage in permissible joking with children. Hazrat Mahmud ibn Rabi' (may Allah be pleased with him) says that he was five years old and remembers that the Noble Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him) rinsed his mouth and sprayed the water on him (Bukhari, 77).

The Mother of the Believers, Sayyidah Aisha al-Siddiqah (may Allah be pleased with her), says that children were brought to the Noble Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him) for him to pray for them. Once, a child was brought to him who urinated on his clothes. He asked for water and poured it over the clothes (Bukhari, 222).

Hazrat Abdullah ibn Abbas (may Allah be pleased with him) says that he was young when the Noble Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him) was praying in Mina. He was moving between the rows, and the Noble Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him) did not stop him (Bukhari, Hadith 76).

> **عَنْ أَنَسٍ ـ رضى الله عنه ـ قَالَ كَانَ النَّبِيُّ صلى الله عليه وسلم أَحْسَنَ النَّاسِ خُلُقًا، وَكَانَ لِي أَخٌ يُقَالُ لَهُ أَبُو عُمَيْرٍ ـ قَالَ أَحْسِبُهُ فَطِيمًا ـ وَكَانَ إِذَا جَاءَ قَالَ ‏ "‏ يَا أَبَا عُمَيْرٍ مَا فَعَلَ النُّغَيْرُ ‏"‏‏.‏ نُغَرٌ كَانَ يَلْعَبُ بِهِ**
>
> *Anas (may Allah be pleased with him) said, "The Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him) was the best of all the people in character. I had a brother called Abu `Umair, who, I think, had been newly weaned. Whenever he came to the Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him), he would say, 'O Abu `Umair! What did the Nughair (a small bird) do?' It was a Nughair with which he used to play."*
> — Bukhari, 6203

**Translation:** Hazrat Anas ibn Malik (may Allah be pleased with him) says: The Noble Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him) was the most excellent of all people in character. I had a brother who was called Abu 'Umair. I believe his weaning had just been completed. Whenever he came to the Noble Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him), he would say: "O Abu 'Umair, what did the *Nughair* do?" The *Nughair* was a small bird with which my brother used to play.

Hazrat Anas ibn Malik (may Allah be pleased with him) was a child. He says that the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings be upon him) said to him: **"O one with two ears!"** (*Ya Dhal-Udhunayn*) (Tirmidhi, Hadith 1992).

Neglect, inattention, and excessive scolding from parents become a cause for children's misbehavior. In contrast, leaving a child completely unchecked is also not appropriate. A child who is accustomed to doing as he pleases gets into trouble when he grows up, and sometimes such children, upon not getting their way, leave home or even commit suicide. As the saying goes:

[p. 404]

> Spare the rod and spoil the child.

**Translation:** Save the rod and spoil the child (meaning, ceasing to use the rod spoils the child).

### **The Psychology of Youth**

Most young people are sincere, which is why they are quickly influenced. Every new thing seems attractive to the youth.

> **عَنْ أَبِي الدَّرْدَاءِ، عَنِ النَّبِيِّ صلى الله عليه وسلم قَالَ ‏"‏ حُبُّكَ الشَّىْءَ يُعْمِي وَيُصِمُّ ‏"**
>
> *Narrated Abu al-Darda': The Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him) said: "Your love for a thing can make you blind and deaf."*
> — Abu Dawud, 5130; Musnad Ahmad, 21751, 27616

**Translation:** Hazrat Abu al-Darda' (may Allah be pleased with him) narrated from the Noble Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him) that he said: "Your love for something makes you blind and deaf."

Being quickly influenced is called *talween* (coloration) in the language of *tasawwuf*, meaning to take on a color. Therefore, things like friendship with every new person, love at first sight, marrying by choice, choosing a field of study by preference, and every new industry and product, as well as changing one's creed and religion, are more commonly found among the youth. The true religion is Islam, the path of the Sunnah, and *tasawwuf*.

Various movements have taken great advantage of this weakness in the youth. College students have engaged in extensive vandalism, strikes, and burning of buses. It is not appropriate to hand over leadership to the youth. Inexperience destroys organizations and armies.

> **عَنْ أَبِي هُرَيْرَةَ، قَالَ قَالَ رَسُولُ اللَّهِ صلى الله عليه وسلم ‏"‏ تَعَوَّذُوا بِاللَّهِ مِنْ رَأْسِ السَّبْعِينَ وَمِنْ إِمَارَةِ الصِّبْيَانِ ‏"**
>
> *Narrated Abu Hurayrah: The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings be upon him) said: "Seek refuge in Allah from the turn of the seventieth year and from the leadership of the young."*
> — Musnad Ahmad, Hadith 8302

**Translation:** Hazrat Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him) says that the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings be upon him) said: "Seek refuge in Allah from the turn of the 70th year of Hijra and from the leadership of the youth."

[p. 405]

Due to not being reality-oriented, many young people quickly fall into an inferiority complex or a superiority complex. It is necessary to think positively about them, to consider them sincere and simple, and to reform and encourage them. There is a seemingly small but very important difference between flattery and encouragement, and between refined manners and affectation.

Some young boys and girls fall victim to an inferiority complex simply due to their complexion, facial blemishes, acne, or weight gain, or because of their short stature and being teased by friends. However, these weaknesses do not go against a person's greatness, and worse flaws and weaknesses exist in others, and all these things are treatable.

Taking the initiative in greeting, responding to greetings with warmth, shaking hands firmly, asking about the other's well-being, saying *Alhamdulillah* if the other asks about your well-being and then asking about theirs, making eye contact and smiling while asking about their well-being, calling others by their full name, listening attentively to everyone's troubles, not sharing your own troubles with everyone, and showing sincere empathy to others—all these make a person beloved by all and solve many of the psychological problems of the youth.

Some young people, when they see a close friend chatting with others, feel that perhaps they are doing it to show off to them, that they have united against them and have made a plan to provoke them. Or when someone looks at them intently, they see contempt and criticism in that look. However, this is merely an internal feeling and a deception of their own thinking.

### **The Psychology of the Elderly**

In old age, childhood returns. This is why the disposition of a child and an old person is nervous and phlegmatic. Allah the Most Generous says:

> **وَمَن نُّعَمِّرْهُ نُنَكِّسْهُ فِي الْخَلْقِ ۖ أَفَلَا يَعْقِلُونَ**
>
> *"And he to whom We grant long life, We reverse him in creation. Will they not then understand?"*
> — Quran, 36:68

[p. 406]

**Translation:** Whomever We grant a long life, We reverse him in his creation. So do these people not understand?

Parents, due to the helplessness of old age and because they raised their children in their childhood, expect good from them. And indeed, justice demands that they be treated with respect and served. Allah the Almighty says:

> **وَقَضَىٰ رَبُّكَ أَلَّا تَعْبُدُوا إِلَّا إِيَّاهُ وَبِالْوَالِدَيْنِ إِحْسَانًا ۚ إِمَّا يَبْلُغَنَّ عِندَكَ الْكِبَرَ أَحَدُهُمَا أَوْ كِلَاهُمَا فَلَا تَقُل لَّهُمَا أُفٍّ وَلَا تَنْهَرْهُمَا وَقُل لَّهُمَا قَوْلًا كَرِيمًا**
>
> *"And your Lord has decreed that you not worship except Him, and to parents, good treatment. Whether one or both of them reach old age [while] with you, say not to them [so much as], 'uff,' and do not repel them but speak to them a noble word."*
> — Quran, 17:23

**Translation:** And your Lord has decreed that you, O people, worship none but Him, and treat your parents well. If one or both of them reach old age in your presence, do not even say "uff" to them, nor scold them, but speak to them with respect.

An old person, due to being experienced, is a precious diamond. Sheikh Saadi (may Allah have mercy on him) says:

> *Barā-ye jahān dīdagān kār kun*
> *Ke ṣayd āzmūdast gurg-e-kuhan*

**Translation:** Work with the consultation of the world-wise, for the old wolf is experienced in the ways of the hunt.

However, a world-wise old person often falls prey to greed as well. The Noble Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him) said:

> **قَلْبُ الشَّيْخِ شَابٌّ عَلَى حُبِّ اثْنَتَيْنِ طُولِ الْحَيَاةِ وَحُبِّ الْمَالِ**
>
> *"The heart of an old person remains young in its love for two things: long life and love of wealth."*
> — Muslim, 1046

### **The Psychology of Women**

The matters before marriage have been discussed in the section on the psychology of children. The practical life of the parents plays a huge role in teaching daughters recitation [of the Quran] and good character. Cooking, cleaning, respecting elders, tolerance, considering in-laws as parents, not getting upset and leaving after marriage, contentment, and other such teachings are the greatest gifts from parents to their daughters.

After marriage, the circumstances of girls change completely. The in-laws can be rich or poor, their own relatives or strangers. The daughter of people who are accustomed to always taking their daughter's side and rushing over after hearing only her one-sided story can never settle in her home.

The Noble Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him) never complained about any of his purified wives to their parents. This is a most magnificent marital character.

[p. 407]

Once, Hazrat Abu Bakr al-Siddiq (may Allah be pleased with him) came to the service of the Noble Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him). He heard the voice of the Mother of the Believers, Aisha al-Siddiqah (may Allah be pleased with her), raised. When he entered, he began to slap her and said: "You raise your voice to the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings be upon him)?" The Noble Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him) began to stop him, and Abu Bakr left in anger. The Noble Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him) said: "O Aisha, did you see how I saved you?" A few days later, Abu Bakr came again and saw that the two (beloveds of Allah) had reconciled. He said: "Just as you included me in your quarrel, include me in your reconciliation as well." The Noble Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him) said: "**We have done so, we have done so**" (Abu Dawud, Hadith 4999).

An important aspect of women's psychology is that they want to see themselves respected in their in-laws' home. And indeed, as much as possible, they should be given respect. If the husband disrespects her in front of his family members, her heart is broken. Besides this, encouraging a woman in her household chores and cooking, praising the food she has cooked, and eating with her boosts her morale, and this is a source of free peace in any home.

If, God forbid, there is a quarrel and discord between husband and wife, in most homes, there is an attempt to end the discord with more discord. It is necessary to understand that you cannot prove your husband wrong with arguments, nor can you succeed. When arguments are given with the intention of reconciliation after a quarrel, the matter gets even more heated. Allah the Almighty says:

[p. 408]

> **يَا أَيُّهَا النَّاسُ اتَّقُوا رَبَّكُمُ الَّذِي خَلَقَكُم مِّن نَّفْسٍ وَاحِدَةٍ وَخَلَقَ مِنْهَا زَوْجَهَا وَبَثَّ مِنْهُمَا رِجَالًا كَثِيرًا وَنِسَاءً ۚ وَاتَّقُوا اللَّهَ الَّذِي تَسَاءَلُونَ بِهِ وَالْأَرْحَامَ ۚ إِنَّ اللَّهَ كَانَ عَلَيْكُمْ رَقِيبًا**
>
> *"O mankind, fear your Lord, who created you from one soul and created from it its mate and dispersed from both of them many men and women. And fear Allah, through whom you ask one another, and the wombs. Indeed, Allah is ever, over you, an Observer."*
> — Quran, 4:1

**Translation:** O people! Fear your Lord, who created you from a single soul (Adam) and from it created its spouse (Hawa), and from both of them spread countless men and women. And fear Allah, by whose name you ask of one another, and (fear) severing family ties. Indeed, Allah is ever watchful over you.

> **عَنْ أَبِي هُرَيْرَةَ ـ رضى الله عنه ـ قَالَ قَالَ رَسُولُ اللَّهِ صلى الله عليه وسلم ‏"‏ اسْتَوْصُوا بِالنِّسَاءِ، فَإِنَّ الْمَرْأَةَ خُلِقَتْ مِنْ ضِلَعٍ، وَإِنَّ أَعْوَجَ شَىْءٍ فِي الضِّلَعِ أَعْلاَهُ، فَإِنْ ذَهَبْتَ تُقِيمُهُ كَسَرْتَهُ، وَإِنْ تَرَكْتَهُ لَمْ يَزَلْ أَعْوَجَ، فَاسْتَوْصُوا بِالنِّسَاءِ ‏"**
>
> *Narrated Abu Hurayrah: Allah's Messenger (peace and blessings be upon him) said, "Treat women kindly, for woman was created from a rib, and the most crooked part of the rib is its upper part. If you try to straighten it, you will break it, and if you leave it, it will remain crooked. So treat women kindly."*
> — Bukhari, 3331

**Translation:** Hazrat Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him) narrates that the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings be upon him) said: "Be good to women, for a woman is created from a rib, and the uppermost part of the rib is the most crooked. If you try to straighten it, you will break it, and if you leave it, it will remain crooked. So, be good to women."

An important psychological aspect of married life is that often, both husband and wife are sincere to each other but do not try to understand the matter with a positive assumption (*husn al-zann*). Often, a quarrel is due to the husband's temperament. The arrogance of superiority and being a husband is at play. A husband who can tolerate a sharp-tongued woman soon becomes a saint (*wali*). Similarly, a woman who can tolerate a harsh-tempered husband soon becomes accepted in the court of Allah.

[p. 409]

Women who are influenced by the media and walk around with their hair uncovered are often good at heart; they have not received proper guidance. Yet, when the time comes, some of them find the right path.

### **The Psychology of Preaching (*Tabligh*)**

#### **Strategy**

Allah the Most Generous says:

> **ادْعُ إِلَىٰ سَبِيلِ رَبِّكَ بِالْحِكْمَةِ وَالْمَوْعِظَةِ الْحَسَنَةِ وَجَادِلْهُم بِالَّتِي هِيَ أَحْسَنُ ۚ إِنَّ رَبَّكَ هُوَ أَعْلَمُ بِمَن ضَلَّ عَن سَبِيلِهِ ۖ وَهُوَ أَعْلَمُ بِالْمُهْتَدِينَ**
>
> *"Invite to the way of your Lord with wisdom and good instruction, and argue with them in a way that is best. Indeed, your Lord is most knowing of who has strayed from His way, and He is most knowing of who is [rightly] guided."*
> — Quran, 16:125

**Translation:** Invite to the way of your Lord with wisdom and good counsel, and reason with them in the best manner. Indeed, your Lord knows best those who have strayed from His path, and He knows best those who are guided.

A gentle approach and a sweet tone for explaining things is the way of the Prophets, provided that the other person has not made a mistake that requires public correction. One should explain in simple, straightforward words. The Quran refers to this as **"sound speech" (*qawlan sadida*)**. The Noble Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him) taught this prayer to Sayyiduna Ali al-Murtada (may Allah be pleased with him): "O Allah, I ask You for guidance and steadfastness" (Muslim, 2725).

It is narrated from Ibn 'Umar that he said: Two men from the East came during the time of the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings be upon him). They stood and spoke, then sat down. Then Thabit ibn Qays, the orator of the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings be upon him), stood and spoke, then sat down. The people were amazed by their speech. The Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him) stood and said: "O people, speak in your [natural] way, for verbal embellishment is from Satan." The Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him) also said: "Indeed, some speech is magic" (Musnad Ahmad, Hadith 5687; Ibn Hibban, Hadith 5718).

[p. 410]

**Translation:** Hazrat Abdullah ibn 'Umar (may Allah be pleased with them) said: During the time of the Noble Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him), two orators came from the East. Both stood and delivered a speech, then both sat down. And the orator of the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings be upon him), Hazrat Thabit ibn Qays, stood up and delivered a speech. Then he sat down. The people were very impressed by all their speeches. So the Noble Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him) stood up and said: "O people! Maintain your simple way of speaking. Eloquence in speech is from Satan." The Noble Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him) also said: "Indeed, there is magic in eloquence."

> *Narrated Abu Umamah: A young man came to the Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him) and said, "O Messenger of Allah, give me permission to commit Zina (fornication)." The people turned to him and rebuked him, saying, "Stop, stop!" But the Prophet said, "Come closer." He came closer and sat down. The Prophet said, "Would you like it for your mother?" He said, "No, by Allah, may Allah make me a ransom for you." The Prophet said, "And people do not like it for their mothers." He said, "Would you like it for your daughter?" He said, "No, by Allah, O Messenger of Allah, may Allah make me a ransom for you." The Prophet said, "And people do not like it for their daughters." He said, "Would you like it for your sister?" He said, "No, by Allah, may Allah make me a ransom for you." The Prophet said, "And people do not like it for their sisters." He said, "Would you like it for your paternal aunt?" He said, "No, by Allah, may Allah make me a ransom for you." The Prophet said, "And people do not like it for their paternal aunts." He said, "Would you like it for your maternal aunt?" He said, "No, by Allah, may Allah make me a ransom for you." The Prophet said, "And people do not like it for their maternal aunts." Then he placed his hand on him and said, "O Allah, forgive his sin, purify his heart, and guard his chastity." After that, the young man never paid attention to anything of the sort.*
> — Musnad Ahmad, Hadith 22211

**Translation:** Hazrat Abu Umamah (may Allah be pleased with him) says that a young man came to the Noble Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him) and said, "O Messenger of Allah, give me permission to commit fornication." All the people turned their attention to him and began to stop him, saying, "Stop, stop!" He (peace and blessings be upon him) said, "Come near me." He came close, and the Prophet said, "Would you like this for your mother?" He said, "No, I swear by Allah, may I be sacrificed for you." The Prophet said, "Similarly, people do not like this for their mothers." He asked, "Would you like this for your daughter?" He said, "No, I swear by Allah, O Messenger of Allah, may I be sacrificed for you." The Prophet said, "Similarly, people do not like this for their daughters." He asked, "Would you like this for your sister?" He said, "No, I swear by Allah, may I be sacrificed for you." The Prophet said, "Similarly, people do not like this for their sisters." He asked, "Would you like this for your paternal aunt?" He said, "No, I swear by Allah, may I be sacrificed for you." The Prophet said, "Similarly, people do not like this for their paternal aunts." He asked, "Would you like this for your maternal aunt?" He said, "No, I swear by Allah, may I be sacrificed for you." The Prophet said, "Similarly, people do not like this for their maternal aunts." Then he placed his blessed hand on the young man and said, "O Allah, forgive his sin, purify his heart, and protect his chastity." After that, the young man never turned his attention towards any evil.

> *Narrated Abu Hurayrah: A man came to the Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him) and said, "O Allah's Messenger! A black son has been born to me." The Prophet said, "Have you got camels?" He said, "Yes." The Prophet said, "What color are they?" He said, "They are red." The Prophet said, "Is there a grey one among them?" He said, "Yes." The Prophet said, "Whence came that?" He said, "Perhaps it is due to hereditary disposition." The Prophet said, "So, perhaps this son of yours is due to the same reason."*
> — Bukhari, 5305

**Translation:** Hazrat Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him) says that a man came to the Noble Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him) and said, "O Messenger of Allah, a black-colored son has been born to me" (while neither I nor my wife is black). He (peace and blessings be upon him) asked, "Do you own camels?" He replied, "Yes." The Prophet asked, "What are their colors?" He replied, "Red." The Prophet asked, "Is there any of blackish color among them?" He replied, "Yes." The Prophet asked, "Where did this color come from?" He replied, "Perhaps a vein pulled it." The Prophet said, "It is possible that your son also pulled a vein."

If someone makes a mistake, others should not taunt him for it. By taunting, he will only get worse. In fact, if someone is taunted after having repented, such a person sometimes breaks his repentance and reverts to his old ways.

> *...A man who had drunk wine was brought. The Prophet said, "Beat him." Abu Hurayrah said, "So some of us beat him with our hands, some with their shoes, and some with their garments." When he left, some of the people said, "May Allah disgrace you." The Prophet said, "Do not say so. Do not help Satan against him."*
> — Bukhari, 6777

**Translation:** Once, the Noble Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him) punished a man for drinking alcohol. Some hit him with their hands, some with their shoes, and some with their clothes. When they were returning, a man said to the one who had drunk alcohol: "May Allah disgrace you." He (peace and blessings be upon him) said: "Do not say this; do not help Satan against him."

#### **Organizational Reform**

Members of organizations often get stuck here, thinking: "There is no one like my leader." This attitude becomes a major cause of discord in society. Everyone should keep their leader and guide within their limits and not impose them on others. The right to rule over the entire Ummah is granted only to the Prophets (peace be upon them).

**Translation:** Hazrat Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him) narrated from the Noble Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him) that he said: "Beware of envy, for envy consumes good deeds just as fire consumes fuel."

> **عَنْ أَبِي هُرَيْرَةَ ـ رضى الله عنه ـ قَالَ قَالَ رَسُولُ اللَّهِ صلى الله عليه وسلم ‏"‏ لَيْسَ الشَّدِيدُ بِالصُّرَعَةِ، إِنَّمَا الشَّدِيدُ الَّذِي يَمْلِكُ نَفْسَهُ عِنْدَ الْغَضَبِ ‏"**

**Translation:** Hazrat Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him) narrates that the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings be upon him) said: "The strong one is not he who wrestles others down, but the strong one is he who controls his *Nafs* at the time of anger."

**Translation:** Hazrat Ibn Mas'ud (may Allah be pleased with him) narrates that the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings be upon him) said: "No person will enter Paradise who has even a mustard seed's weight of arrogance in his heart."

To protect oneself from arrogance and to negate it, one should prescribe such a treatment for oneself that one is humbled by one's own hands, which is disliked [by the *Nafs*].

> **عَنْ حُذَيْفَةَ، قَالَ قَالَ رَسُولُ اللَّهِ صلى الله عليه وسلم ‏"‏ لاَ يَنْبَغِي لِلْمُؤْمِنِ أَنْ يُذِلَّ نَفْسَهُ ‏"**

[p. 414]

#### **Taciturnity (Speaking Less)**

A preacher can develop vanity (*'ujb*) over his religious preaching, numerous writings, and eloquent speeches. Such a preacher often, upon finding a small opportunity during a conversation, begins an unrelated discussion based on his vanity. In such a situation, self-negation and speaking less are the best cures.

> **عَنْ عَبْدِ اللَّهِ بْنِ عَمْرٍو، قَالَ قَالَ رَسُولُ اللَّهِ صلى الله عليه وسلم ‏"‏ مَنْ صَمَتَ نَجَا ‏"**
>

**Translation:** Hazrat Abdullah ibn 'Amr (may Allah be pleased with him) narrates that the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings be upon him) said: "He who remained silent, attained salvation."

#### **Knowledge is That Which Creates Knowledge**

> **عَنْ بُرَيْدَةَ، قَالَ سَمِعْتُ رَسُولَ اللَّهِ صلى الله عليه وسلم يَقُولُ ‏"‏ إِنَّ مِنَ الْعِلْمِ جَهْلاً ‏"**
>
> *Narrated Buraydah: I heard the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings be upon him) say: "Indeed, some knowledge is ignorance."*
> — Abu Dawud, 5012

**Translation:** Hazrat Buraydah (may Allah be pleased with him) says that he heard the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings be upon him) saying: "Indeed, some forms of knowledge are also ignorance."

Once, a delegation from the tribe of 'Abd al-Qays came to the Noble Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him). The people of the delegation came and met the Noble Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him), but their leader dismounted from his ride, changed his clothes, and then came to the Noble Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him) with great composure. The Noble Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him) said to him: "Indeed, you have two qualities that Allah loves: forbearance and deliberation" (Muslim, 17).

One day, Hazrat Imam Hassan al-Mujtaba (may Allah be pleased with him) was present at the gate of the capital in Kufa. A Bedouin came from the desert and, upon arrival, began to curse him and his parents. He asked him: "Are you hungry or thirsty, or has some calamity befallen you?"

[p. 415]

He again said, "You are like this, and your parents are like this." Hazrat Imam Hassan (may Allah be pleased with him) said to his servant: "Bring a tray full of silver." And he gave it to him. Then he said: "O Bedouin, consider us excused. There was nothing else in the house, otherwise I would not have refused to give it." When the Bedouin saw this patience and forbearance, he began to say, "I bear witness that you are indeed the grandson of the Messenger of Allah" (*Kashf al-Mahjub*, page 76).

The grandson of the Messenger of Allah (upon his grandfather and upon him be peace and blessings) explained the matter: upon seeing someone's bad behavior and hearing their foolish talk, instead of flying into a rage, learn to smile under your breath, and you will become a champion in the world of ethics.

#### **Do Not Argue with the Ignorant**

Allah the Most Generous said to His beloved (peace and blessings be upon him):

> **خُذِ الْعَفْوَ وَأْمُرْ بِالْعُرْفِ وَأَعْرِضْ عَنِ الْجَاهِلِينَ**
>
> *"Show forgiveness, enjoin what is good, and turn away from the ignorant."*
> — Quran, 7:199

**Translation:** Make forgiveness your habit, and command what is right, and do not argue with the ignorant.

#### **The Effects of Propaganda**

A person is influenced by the company he keeps. If, through propaganda, even the worst of men is called good, people become his devotees and do not investigate. Similarly, if propaganda is available against the most righteous of beings, people become suspicious of him and do not investigate. The abundance of propaganda turns a lie into truth, and truth into a lie.

Allah the Most Generous says:

> **يَا أَيُّهَا الَّذِينَ آمَنُوا إِن جَاءَكُمْ فَاسِقٌ بِنَبَإٍ فَتَبَيَّنُوا**
>
> *"O you who have believed, if there comes to you a disobedient one with information, investigate..."*
> — Quran, 49:6

**Translation:** O you who believe, if a sinner brings you news, then investigate it.

The Noble Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him) said:

> **كَفَى بِالْمَرْءِ كَذِبًا أَنْ يُحَدِّثَ بِكُلِّ مَا سَمِعَ**
>
> *"It is enough for a man to be a liar that he narrates everything he hears."*
> — Muslim, 5

[p. 416]

> **عَنِ ابْنِ عَبَّاسٍ، قَالَ قَالَ رَسُولُ اللَّهِ صلى الله عليه وسلم ‏"‏ لَيْسَ الْخَبَرُ كَالْمُعَايَنَةِ ‏"**
>
> *Narrated Ibn 'Abbas: The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings be upon him) said: "Hearing is not like seeing."*
> — Musnad Ahmad, 2451

A hostile environment, and especially the gossip of an organizational environment, often leads one away from the truth. Whoever one is opposed to, there is undue criticism, fatwa-mongering, and a heated market of sensationalism against him, and such people keep fueling suspicion about their opponent. But if such people sit alone and think about their opponent, their own actions become a burden on their conscience. That is why Allah the Most Generous says:

> **قُلْ إِنَّمَا أَعِظُكُم بِوَاحِدَةٍ ۖ أَن تَقُومُوا لِلَّهِ مَثْنَىٰ وَفُرَادَىٰ ثُمَّ تَتَفَكَّرُوا ۚ مَا بِصَاحِبِكُم مِّن جِنَّةٍ ۚ إِنْ هُوَ إِلَّا نَذِيرٌ لَّكُم بَيْنَ يَدَيْ عَذَابٍ شَدِيدٍ**
>
> *"Say, 'I only advise you of one [thing] - that you stand for Allah, [seeking truth] in pairs and individually, and then give thought.' There is not in your companion any madness. He is only a warner to you before a severe punishment."*
> — Quran, 34:46

**Translation:** Say: "I give you but one counsel: that you stand up for Allah, in pairs and singly, and then reflect. There is no madness in your companion (the Prophet). He is but a warner to you (in time) before a severe punishment."

Islam has placed great emphasis on adopting good company. The Noble Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him) said:

> **لاَ تُصَاحِبْ إِلاَّ مُؤْمِنًا وَلاَ يَأْكُلْ طَعَامَكَ إِلاَّ تَقِيٌّ**
>
> *"Do not accompany anyone but a believer, and do not let anyone eat your food but one who is pious."*
> — Tirmidhi, 2395; Abu Dawud, 4832; Darimi, 2061; Musnad Ahmad, 11343

**Translation:** Do not sit in the company of anyone except a believer, and let no one eat your food except a pious person.

> **عَنْ أَبِي هُرَيْرَةَ، أَنَّ النَّبِيَّ صلى الله عليه وسلم قَالَ ‏"‏ الرَّجُلُ عَلَى دِينِ خَلِيلِهِ فَلْيَنْظُرْ أَحَدُكُمْ مَنْ يُخَالِلُ ‏"**
>
> *Narrated Abu Hurayrah: The Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him) said: "A man is upon the religion of his best friend, so let one of you look at whom he befriends."*
> — Abu Dawud, 4833; Tirmidhi, 2378

**Translation:** Sayyiduna Abu Hurayrah narrates that the Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him) said: "A man is on the religion of his friend, so each of you should consider whom he befriends."

[p. 417]

#### **General Psychology**

##### **Different Kinds of People**

There is a segment of people who are only concerned with their livelihood and raising their children; such people often serve as the nursery for new movements and different religions. A second segment is relatively religious and tries to pray and attend Friday and Eid prayers, but does not take much interest beyond this. A third segment is one that is attached to a religious personality or is a disciple of someone, and that's it. In these three segments, some people possess great ability, but their abilities remain limited to their livelihood or, at most, to regional leadership and council matters. A fourth segment is one that is attached to an organization or a movement and also reads literature or receives training from their guide, and among such disciples, there are also many ranks and classes. A fifth segment is that of students who are sometimes attached to organizations, although they should be focusing on their education, not on the organization. A sixth segment is that of orators, whether they have knowledge or not; in this same segment, ignorant and extremist spiritual guides should also be counted, and common poets also fall into this segment. A seventh segment is of those people who, in today's age, acquire religious knowledge by moving around, and for this reason, they are liberal-minded; they present research that is against the consensus (*ijma'*) and the majority (*jumhur*). If such a person also has the ability to speak or somehow gets on the media, he creates a strange spectacle. Such a person, in the light of his limited information, creates a very beautiful narrative that is contrary to many fundamental religious teachings, and the people of knowledge are left holding their heads. But what do the common people know? Due to not being bound by any principle, the statements of such people are also contradictory among themselves. To cover up this weakness, such people start giving lessons on open-mindedness to others. An eighth segment is that of school teachers and college professors.

[p. 418]

At approximately the same level are senior journalists, doctors, physicians, lawyers, and people from the civil services. If such people maintain contact with a deep scholarly and religious personality, they can play an excellent role in their circles. A ninth segment is that of professors of Islamic studies, M.Phil., and Ph.D. holders. If such people adhere to the consensus and the majority, they can do great work. In Pakistan, such people are working in large numbers with this adherence, and their sincerity and religious spirit are worthy of praise. A tenth segment is that of the scholars and teachers of religious seminaries, who, along with open-mindedness, also understand its limits and constraints. Some of these individuals also become professors. This is the top segment in terms of exoteric knowledge. An eleventh segment is that of the masters of the spiritual path and the people of knowledge and wisdom from among these same scholars, who are the true heirs of the Prophets (peace be upon them). This classification is merely inductive; Allah the Most Generous can pick up whomever He wills from wherever and place them wherever.

Sayyiduna, the Pivot of Pivots, Hazrat Sheikh Abdul Qadir Jilani (may his secret be sanctified) has provided another extremely excellent classification. He says: People are of four types. First, those who have neither a tongue nor a heart, the purely heedless. Invite such people. Second, those who have a tongue but no heart, the scholars without action. Seek refuge in Allah from such hypocrites. Third, those who have a heart but no tongue, the secluded, the silent, those who keep an eye on their own faults. The company of such people is beneficial. Fourth, those who have been granted honor and greatness in the celestial realm, the trustees of divine secrets and sciences, appointed for the reformation of creation, the successors of the Prophets (peace be upon them), the essence of humanity, and those who hold the highest rank after the Prophets. Do not oppose them (summary of *Futuh al-Ghaib*, Discourse 33).

> **عَنْ عَائِشَةَ، أَنَّ النَّبِيَّ صلى الله عليه وسلم قَالَ ‏"‏ أَنْزِلُوا النَّاسَ مَنَازِلَهُمْ ‏"**
>
> *Narrated 'Aishah: The Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him) said: "Treat people according to their respective ranks."*
> — Abu Dawud, 4842

**Translation:** Hazrat Aisha al-Siddiqah (may Allah be pleased with her) says that the Noble Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him) said: "Interact with people according to their status."

[p. 419]

Those who are in the majority in any area, the foolish among them are also in the majority. Most simple-minded people will be forgiven due to the sincerity of their intention. The Noble Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him) said:

> **إِنَّ أَكْثَرَ أَهْلِ الْجَنَّةِ الْبُلْهُ**
>
> *"Indeed, the majority of the inhabitants of Paradise are the simple-minded."*
> — Mushkil al-Athar by al-Tahawi, Vol. 2, p. 81

#### **Who is Beloved to Allah?**

Among the various types and groups of people, the one most beloved to Allah is he who fears Allah. And one who fears Allah never oppresses anyone and does not taunt based on ethnicity, lineage, profession, or poverty. And one who knows this reality does not fall victim to an inferiority complex due to his small ethnicity, lineage, profession, or poverty. Allah the Almighty says:

> **يَا أَيُّهَا النَّاسُ إِنَّا خَلَقْنَاكُم مِّن ذَكَرٍ وَأُنثَىٰ وَجَعَلْنَاكُمْ شُعُوبًا وَقَبَائِلَ لِتَعَارَفُوا ۚ إِنَّ أَكْرَمَكُمْ عِندَ اللَّهِ أَتْقَاكُمْ ۚ إِنَّ اللَّهَ عَلِيمٌ خَبِيرٌ**
>
> *"O mankind, indeed We have created you from male and female and made you peoples and tribes that you may know one another. Indeed, the most noble of you in the sight of Allah is the most righteous of you. Indeed, Allah is Knowing and Acquainted."*
> — Quran, 49:13

**Translation:** O people! We have created you from a male and a female, and We have made you into (different) large nations and tribes so that you may recognize one another. Indeed, the most honorable among you in the sight of Allah is he who is the most pious among you. Indeed, Allah is All-Knowing, Well-Aware.

> **وَنَعْلَمُ مَا تُوَسْوِسُ بِهِ نَفْسُهُ ۖ وَنَحْنُ أَقْرَبُ إِلَيْهِ مِنْ حَبْلِ الْوَرِيدِ**
>
> *"And We know what his soul whispers to him, and We are closer to him than [his] jugular vein."*
> — Quran, 50:16

**Translation:** And We know the whisperings that his commanding soul (instills in his heart), and We are closer to him than his jugular vein.

> **عَنْ أَبِي هُرَيْرَةَ، عَنْ رَسُولِ اللَّهِ صلى الله عليه وسلم قَالَ ‏"‏ إِذَا نَظَرَ أَحَدُكُمْ إِلَى مَنْ فُضِّلَ عَلَيْهِ فِي الْمَالِ وَالْخَلْقِ فَلْيَنْظُرْ إِلَى مَنْ هُوَ أَسْفَلَ مِنْهُ ‏"**
>
> *Narrated Abu Hurayrah: The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings be upon him) said: "When one of you looks at one who is superior to him in property and appearance, he should look at one who is inferior to him."*
> — Bukhari, 6490

[p. 420]

**Translation:** When any of you looks at someone who has been given superiority over him in wealth and physical form, he should look at someone who is of a lower degree than him among those over whom he has been given superiority.

> **عَنْ أَبِي هُرَيْرَةَ، قَالَ قَالَ رَسُولُ اللَّهِ صلى الله عليه وسلم ‏"‏ لَيْسَ الْغِنَى عَنْ كَثْرَةِ الْعَرَضِ وَلَكِنَّ الْغِنَى غِنَى النَّفْسِ ‏"**
>
> *Narrated Abu Hurayrah: The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings be upon him) said: "Richness is not in having many possessions, but richness is the richness of the soul."*
> — Muslim, 1051

**Translation:** Hazrat Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him) says that the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings be upon him) said: "Richness is not having a lot of wealth, but richness is the richness of the heart."

> **عَنْ عَبْدِ اللَّهِ بْنِ عَمْرِو بْنِ الْعَاصِ، أَنَّ رَسُولَ اللَّهِ صلى الله عليه وسلم قَالَ ‏"‏ قَدْ أَفْلَحَ مَنْ أَسْلَمَ وَرُزِقَ كَفَافًا وَقَنَّعَهُ اللَّهُ بِمَا آتَاهُ ‏"**
>
> *Narrated 'Abdullah bin 'Amr bin Al-'As: The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings be upon him) said: "He has succeeded who accepts Islam, is provided with sufficient sustenance, and is made content by Allah with what He has given him."*
> — Muslim, 1054

**Translation:** Hazrat Abdullah ibn 'Amr ibn al-'As (may Allah be pleased with him) narrates that the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings be upon him) said: "Indeed, he is successful who becomes a Muslim, is given sufficient provision, and Allah grants him contentment with what He has given him."

#### **Who is Wise Among People?**

The wisest person is he who remembers his death. A life planned with death in mind is extremely successful. A far-sighted person is considered a great and noble person, and there is no one more far-sighted than one who is mindful of death.

> **عَنِ ابْنِ عُمَرَ، قَالَ: كُنْتُ مَعَ رَسُولِ اللَّهِ صَلَّى اللهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّمَ، فَجَاءَهُ رَجُلٌ مِنَ الْأَنْصَارِ، فَسَلَّمَ عَلَى النَّبِيِّ صَلَّى اللهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّمَ، ثُمَّ قَالَ: يَا رَسُولَ اللَّهِ أَيُّ الْمُؤْمِنِينَ أَفْضَلُ؟ قَالَ: «أَحْسَنُهُمْ خُلُقًا» ، قَالَ: فَأَيُّ الْمُؤْمِنِينَ أَكْيَسُ؟ قَالَ: «أَكْثَرُهُمْ لِلْمَوْتِ ذِكْرًا، وَأَحْسَنُهُمْ لِمَا بَعْدَهُ اسْتِعْدَادًا، أُولَئِكَ الْأَكْيَاسُ»**
>
> *Narrated Ibn 'Umar: I was with the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings be upon him) when a man from the Ansar came, greeted the Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him) and said: "O Messenger of Allah, which of the believers is best?" He said: "The best of them in character." He said: "Which of the believers is the wisest?" He said: "The one who remembers death the most, and is best prepared for what comes after it. Those are the wise ones."*
> — Ibn Majah, 4259 (similar narration in Al-Awsat by al-Tabarani, 6488)

[p. 421]

**Translation:** Hazrat Abdullah ibn 'Umar (may Allah be pleased with them) says that he was in the service of the Noble Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him) on the tenth day of the tenth month. A man from the Ansar came to him and asked, "O Prophet of Allah! Who is the wisest and most prudent among all people?" He replied: "The one among them who remembers death the most and is most prepared for death before it descends. Such people are the wisest; they have attained the honor of this world and the dignity of the Hereafter."

> **عَنْ أَنَسٍ، قَالَ رَجُلٌ لِلنَّبِيِّ صَلَّى اللهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّمَ: أَوْصِنِي، قَالَ: «خُذِ الْأَمْرَ بِالتَّدْبِيرِ، فَإِنْ رَأَيْتَ فِي عَاقِبَتِهِ خَيْرًا فَامْضِهِ، وَإِنْ خِفْتَ غَيًّا فَأَمْسِكْ»**
>
> *Narrated Anas: A man said to the Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him), "Advise me." He said, "Approach matters with deliberation. If you see good in its outcome, then proceed. And if you fear harm, then refrain."*
> — Sharh al-Sunnah, 3600

**Translation:** Hazrat Anas (may Allah be pleased with him) says that a man asked the Noble Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him) to advise him. He said: "Handle matters with deliberation. If you see that there is good in its outcome, then do it, and if you feel there is a risk of loss in it, then stop."

People who become engrossed in temporary pleasure and luxury and fall prey to pride are suddenly struck by a calamity, as a result of which they are left only with regret and wringing their hands. Allah the Most Generous says:

> **فَلَمَّا نَسُوا مَا ذُكِّرُوا بِهِ فَتَحْنَا عَلَيْهِمْ أَبْوَابَ كُلِّ شَيْءٍ حَتَّىٰ إِذَا فَرِحُوا بِمَا أُوتُوا أَخَذْنَاهُم بَغْتَةً فَإِذَا هُم مُّبْلِسُونَ**
>
> *"So when they forgot that by which they had been reminded, We opened to them the doors of every [good] thing until, when they rejoiced in that which they were given, We seized them unexpectedly, and they were in despair."*
> — Quran, 6:44

**Translation:** When they forgot the advice, We opened the gates of everything for them temporarily, until when they began to exult in what they were given, We seized them suddenly, and then they were left in despair.

##### **Learn a Lesson**

This world is a great place of experience. The hadith says that no one can become wise without experience, and no one can become forbearing without stumbling (Tirmidhi, Hadith 2033).

[p. 422]

It is only by stumbling once that gnosis (*ma'rifah*) is attained. The Quran calls this a lesson (*'ibrah*), and the hadith says:

> **عَنْ أَبِي هُرَيْرَةَ ـ رضى الله عنه ـ عَنِ النَّبِيِّ صلى الله عليه وسلم أَنَّهُ قَالَ ‏"‏ لاَ يُلْدَغُ الْمُؤْمِنُ مِنْ جُحْرٍ وَاحِدٍ مَرَّتَيْنِ ‏"**
>
> *Narrated Abu Hurayrah: The Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him) said, "A believer is not stung from the same hole twice."*
> — Bukhari, 6133; Muslim, 2998; Abu Dawud, 4862

**Translation:** Hazrat Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him) narrates that the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings be upon him) said: "A believer is not bitten from the same hole twice."

##### **Haste**

> **وَيَدْعُ الْإِنسَانُ بِالشَّرِّ دُعَاءَهُ بِالْخَيْرِ ۖ وَكَانَ الْإِنسَانُ عَجُولًا**
>
> *"And man supplicates for evil as he supplicates for good, and man is ever hasty."*
> — Quran, 17:11

**Translation:** And man begins to pray for evil just as he prays for good, and man is indeed very hasty.

> **خُلِقَ الْإِنسَانُ مِنْ عَجَلٍ ۚ سَأُرِيكُمْ آيَاتِي فَلَا تَسْتَعْجِلُونِ**
>
> *"Man was created of haste. I will show you My signs, so do not ask Me to hasten."*
> — Quran, 21:37

**Translation:** Man was created hasty. (O people,) soon I will show you My signs, so do not be hasty with Me.

> **عَنْ سَهْلِ بْنِ سَعْدٍ، أَنَّ النَّبِيَّ صلى الله عليه وسلم قَالَ ‏"‏ الأَنَاةُ مِنَ اللَّهِ وَالْعَجَلَةُ مِنَ الشَّيْطَانِ ‏"**
>
> *Narrated Sahl ibn Sa'd: The Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him) said: "Deliberation is from Allah, and haste is from the Satan."*
> — Tirmidhi, 2012 (and he said it is Gharib)

**Translation:** Hazrat Sahl ibn Sa'd (may Allah be pleased with him) says that the Noble Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him) said: "Deliberation is from Allah, and haste is from Satan."

##### **The Wealth of Certainty**

> **قَالَ رَسُولُ اللهِ صَلَّى اللهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّمَ: " يَا أَيُّهَا النَّاسُ، إِنَّ النَّاسَ لَمْ يُعْطَوْا شَيْئًا خَيْرًا مِنَ الْيَقِينِ وَالْمُعَافَاةِ، فَاسْأَلُوهُمَا اللهَ عَزَّ وَجَلَّ "**
>
> *The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings be upon him) said: "O people, indeed people have not been given anything better than certainty and well-being, so ask Allah, the Mighty and Majestic, for them."*
> — Musnad Ahmad, Hadith 39

[p. 423]

**Translation:** The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings be upon him) said: "O people! In this world, Allah the Almighty has not bestowed any wealth upon anyone greater than certainty (*yaqeen*) and forgiveness (*'afw*). So ask for certainty and forgiveness from Allah, the Mighty and Majestic."

> **عَنْ أَبِي هُرَيْرَةَ، قَالَ قَالَ رَسُولُ اللَّهِ صلى الله عليه وسلم ‏"‏ الْمُؤْمِنُ الْقَوِيُّ خَيْرٌ وَأَحَبُّ إِلَى اللَّهِ مِنَ الْمُؤْمِنِ الضَّعِيفِ وَفِي كُلٍّ خَيْرٌ احْرِصْ عَلَى مَا يَنْفَعُكَ وَاسْتَعِنْ بِاللَّهِ وَلاَ تَعْجِزْ وَإِنْ أَصَابَكَ شَىْءٌ فَلاَ تَقُلْ لَوْ أَنِّي فَعَلْتُ كَانَ كَذَا وَكَذَا ‏.‏ وَلَكِنْ قُلْ قَدَرُ اللَّهِ وَمَا شَاءَ فَعَلَ ‏.‏ فَإِنَّ لَوْ تَفْتَحُ عَمَلَ الشَّيْطَانِ ‏"**
>
> *Narrated Abu Hurayrah: The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings be upon him) said: "A strong believer is better and is more lovable to Allah than a weak believer, and there is good in everyone. Strive for that which will benefit you, seek the help of Allah, and do not feel helpless. If anything befalls you, do not say, 'If only I had done that, then such and such would have happened.' But say, 'Allah has decreed and what He willed, He has done.' For 'if only' opens the door to the work of Satan."*
> — Muslim, 2664; Ibn Majah, 79

**Translation:** Hazrat Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him) narrates that the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings be upon him) said: "A strong believer is better and more beloved to Allah than a weak believer. And there is good in both. Strive for what benefits you and seek help from Allah and do not be lazy. If some harmful thing befalls you, do not say that if I had done this, it would have been like this, but say: Allah had decreed it, and what He willed, He did. For the word 'if only' opens the door to the actions of Satan."

##### **What is Contentment (*Rida*)?**

Being content with what is ordained brings reward and nearness to Allah, but its psychological reality is that by becoming content with what is ordained, a person's nerves become completely relaxed. Tension is removed, anxiety (*khafaqan*) ends, and a person not only becomes healthy but becomes a king of psychology. This is why the Quranic honor for the Companions, "Allah was pleased with them, and they were pleased with Him" (*radiyallahu 'anhum wa radu 'anhu*), is no ordinary honor. This is the ultimate goal of the purposes of human creation.

Someone has said it well about tension:

> Tension is a self-punishment and wastage of time, it can not change anything but keeps you busy to do nothing.

[p. 424]

**Translation:** Tension is a self-inflicted punishment and a waste of time. It cannot change anything, but it keeps you busy doing nothing.

#### **Suspicion and Spying are Forbidden**

Allah the Almighty says:

> **يَا أَيُّهَا الَّذِينَ آمَنُوا اجْتَنِبُوا كَثِيرًا مِّنَ الظَّنِّ إِنَّ بَعْضَ الظَّنِّ إِثْمٌ ۖ وَلَا تَجَسَّسُوا وَلَا يَغْتَب بَّعْضُكُم بَعْضًا ۚ أَيُحِبُّ أَحَدُكُمْ أَن يَأْكُلَ لَحْمَ أَخِيهِ مَيْتًا فَكَرِهْتُمُوهُ ۚ وَاتَّقُوا اللَّهَ ۚ إِنَّ اللَّهَ تَوَّابٌ رَّحِيمٌ**
>
> *"O you who have believed, avoid much [negative] assumption. Indeed, some assumption is sin. And do not spy or backbite each other. Would one of you like to eat the flesh of his dead brother? You would hate it. And fear Allah; indeed, Allah is Accepting of repentance and Merciful."*
> — Quran, 49:12

**Translation:** O you who believe! Avoid many assumptions. Indeed, some assumptions are a sin. And do not spy (on faults) and do not backbite one another. Would any of you like to eat the flesh of his dead brother? You would (extremely) detest it. And fear Allah. Indeed, Allah is the Accepter of repentance, Most Merciful.

> **عَنْ أَبِي هُرَيْرَةَ، أَنَّ رَسُولَ اللَّهِ صلى الله عليه وسلم قَالَ ‏"‏ إِيَّاكُمْ وَالظَّنَّ فَإِنَّ الظَّنَّ أَكْذَبُ الْحَدِيثِ وَلاَ تَحَسَّسُوا وَلاَ تَجَسَّسُوا وَلاَ تَنَاجَشُوا وَلاَ تَحَاسَدُوا وَلاَ تَبَاغَضُوا وَلاَ تَدَابَرُوا وَكُونُوا عِبَادَ اللَّهِ إِخْوَانًا ‏"**
>
> *Narrated Abu Hurayrah: The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings be upon him) said: "Beware of suspicion, for suspicion is the most false of speech. Do not seek out faults, do not spy, do not outbid each other, do not envy each other, do not hate each other, and do not turn away from each other. And be, O slaves of Allah, brothers."*
> — Bukhari, 6066; Muslim, 2563

**Translation:** Hazrat Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him) narrates that the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings be upon him) said: "Avoid suspicion, for suspicion is the falsest of all talk. Do not eavesdrop on one another, do not spy on one another, do not outbid one another, do not be envious of one another, do not hate one another, and do not be treacherous to one another. And O servants of Allah! Be brothers to one another."

> **عَنْ مُعَاوِيَةَ، قَالَ سَمِعْتُ رَسُولَ اللَّهِ صلى الله عليه وسلم يَقُولُ ‏"‏ إِنَّكَ إِذَا اتَّبَعْتَ عَوْرَاتِ النَّاسِ أَفْسَدْتَهُمْ ‏"**
>
> *Narrated Mu'awiyah: I heard the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings be upon him) say: "If you seek out the faults of the people, you will corrupt them."*
> — Abu Dawud, Hadith 4888

[p. 425]

**Translation:** Hazrat Mu'awiyah (may Allah be pleased with him) says that he heard the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings be upon him) saying: "When you seek the secrets of the people, you will alienate them."

There is a deep connection between suspicion and guesswork, in that a person measures others by himself. It is because of measuring others by oneself that some noble and trusting people are deceived by fraudsters. The Arabic proverb is:

> **الْمَرْءُ يَقِيسُ عَلَى نَفْسِهِ**
>
> *"A man measures others by himself."*

#### **Mockery and Bad Nicknames**

> **يَا أَيُّهَا الَّذِينَ آمَنُوا لَا يَسْخَرْ قَوْمٌ مِّن قَوْمٍ عَسَىٰ أَن يَكُونُوا خَيْرًا مِّنْهُمْ وَلَا نِسَاءٌ مِّن نِّسَاءٍ عَسَىٰ أَن يَكُنَّ خَيْرًا مِّنْهُنَّ ۖ وَلَا تَلْمِزُوا أَنفُسَكُمْ وَلَا تَنَابَزُوا بِالْأَلْقَابِ**
>
> *"O you who have believed, let not a people ridicule [another] people; perhaps they may be better than them; nor let women ridicule [other] women; perhaps they may be better than them. And do not insult one another and do not call each other by [offensive] nicknames."*
> — Quran, 49:11

**Translation:** O you who believe! Let no group mock another group; it is not unlikely that they are better than them (the mockers). And let not women mock other women. And do not taunt one another, nor call each other by bad nicknames.

> **عَنْ أَبِي هُرَيْرَةَ ـ رضى الله عنه ـ عَنِ النَّبِيِّ صلى الله عليه وسلم قَالَ ‏"‏ ... وَالْكَلِمَةُ الطَّيِّبَةُ صَدَقَةٌ ‏"**
>
> *Narrated Abu Hurayrah: The Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him) said: "...and a good word is charity."*
> — Bukhari, 2989

**Translation:** Hazrat Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him) narrates from the Noble Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him) that he said: "A good word is also a charity."

The Noble Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him) used to change inappropriate names. Human psychology is such that everyone likes to hear their full name. As the saying goes:

> The best music which somebody wants to listen to is his own name.

**Translation:** The best music a person wants to hear is his own name.

[p. 426]

#### **The Permissible Method of Winning People Over (*Taskheer*)**

The method of winning people over while keeping Allah the Almighty pleased is the one that the Noble Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him) instructed:

> **ازْهَدْ فِي الدُّنْيَا يُحِبَّكَ اللَّهُ، وَازْهَدْ فِيمَا عِنْدَ النَّاسِ يُحِبَّكَ النَّاسُ**
>
> *"Be detached from the world, and Allah will love you. Be detached from what is in people's hands, and the people will love you."*
> — Ibn Majah, 4102

**Translation:** Become indifferent to the world, and Allah will love you. And become indifferent to what people have, and people will love you.

> **عَنِ ابْنِ عُمَرَ، قَالَ: قَالَ رَسُولُ اللَّهِ صَلَّى اللَّهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّمَ: «الِاقْتِصَادُ فِي النَّفَقَةِ نِصْفُ الْمَعِيشَةِ، وَالتَّوَدُّدُ إِلَى النَّاسِ نِصْفُ الْعَقْلِ، وَحُسْنُ السُّؤَالِ نِصْfُ الْعِلْمِ»**
>
> *Narrated Ibn 'Umar: The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings be upon him) said: "Moderation in spending is half of livelihood, showing affection to people is half of intelligence, and asking good questions is half of knowledge."*
> — Shu'ab al-Iman by al-Bayhaqi, 6568

**Translation:** Hazrat Ibn 'Umar (may Allah be pleased with him) says that the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings be upon him) said: "Moderation in expenditure is half of one's livelihood, showing love to people is half of one's intellect, and the art of questioning is half of knowledge."

#### **The Harms of Disrespect and Its Psychological Effects**

Disrespect towards elders leaves a dangerous mark on a person's conscience. Sometimes, even if one is forgiven, the person cannot forgive himself. Or if he is forgiven, he does not get back on track.

One who abuses someone's parents is, in fact, abusing his own parents. He should know that the same abuse will be returned to him in response. This is what is called keeping the consequences in mind.

> **عَنْ عَبْدِ اللَّهِ بْنِ عَمْرٍو ـ رضى الله عنهما ـ قَالَ قَالَ رَسُولُ اللَّهِ صلى الله عليه وسلم ‏"‏ إِنَّ مِنْ أَكْبَرِ الْكَبَائِرِ أَنْ يَلْعَنَ الرَّجُلُ وَالِدَيْهِ ‏"‏‏.‏ قِيلَ يَا رَسُولَ اللَّهِ وَكَيْفَ يَلْعَنُ الرَّجُلُ وَالِدَيْهِ قَالَ ‏"‏ يَسُبُّ الرَّجُلُ أَبَا الرَّجُلِ، فَيَسُبُّ أَبَاهُ، وَيَسُبُّ أُمَّهُ ‏"**
>
> *Narrated 'Abdullah bin 'Amr: The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings be upon him) said: "It is one of the greatest sins that a man should curse his parents." It was asked, "O Allah's Messenger! How does a man curse his parents?" The Prophet said, "The man abuses the father of another man and he abuses his father, and he abuses his mother."*
> — Bukhari, 5973

[p. 427]

**Translation:** Hazrat Abdullah ibn 'Amr (may Allah be pleased with them) says that the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings be upon him) said: "Among the greatest of major sins is that a person curses his own parents." It was asked, "O Messenger of Allah! How can a person curse his own parents?" He (peace and blessings be upon him) said: "A person abuses another person's father, so he abuses his father, and he abuses his mother."

#### **Psychoanalysis (*Tahlil-e-Nafsi*)**

Psychoanalysis means to remove something that is stuck in the mind. Some people do not forgive themselves. For them, the following prayer is very effective. The Noble Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him) named it **Sayyid al-Istighfar**, meaning the king of supplications for forgiveness:

> **اللَّهُمَّ أَنْتَ رَبِّي لاَ إِلَهَ إِلاَّ أَنْتَ، خَلَقْتَنِي وَأَنَا عَبْدُكَ، وَأَنَا عَلَى عَهْدِكَ وَوَعْدِكَ مَا اسْتَطَعْتُ، أَعُوذُ بِكَ مِنْ شَرِّ مَا صَنَعْتُ، أَبُوءُ لَكَ بِنِعْمَتِكَ عَلَىَّ وَأَبُوءُ لَكَ بِذَنْبِي، فَاغْفِرْ لِي، فَإِنَّهُ لاَ يَغْفِرُ الذُّنُوبَ إِلاَّ أَنْتَ**
>
> *"O Allah, You are my Lord, there is no god but You. You created me and I am Your slave, and I am faithful to my covenant and my promise as much as I can. I seek refuge in You from the evil of what I have done. I acknowledge Your favor upon me, and I acknowledge my sin. So forgive me, for verily none forgives sins except You."*
> — Bukhari, 6306; Tirmidhi, 3393; Nasa'i, 5522

**Translation:** O Allah, You are my Lord. There is no one worthy of worship except You. You created me, and I am Your servant. And I am firm on my covenant with You and my promise to You as much as I am able. I seek refuge in You from the evil of what I have done. I acknowledge the blessings You have bestowed upon me, and I confess my sin before You. So forgive me, for no one forgives sins except You.

The feeling of sin is a great thing, and this is what becomes the cause of true repentance. That is why the Noble Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him) said: "Regret is repentance" (*al-nadam tawbah*) (Mishkat, 2363).

O dear one! The mercy of your Lord is so dominant over your mistakes that your confession itself is forgiveness.

[p. 428]

### **The Psychology of Rulers**

Secular rulers always operate on a policy of saving their government. Instead of the fear of Allah the Almighty, the fear of some worldly superpower haunts them. The ethics of politicians are often political. Even their religious interests, participation in funeral prayers, and `Umrah` are all political, except for the one to whom Allah grants sincerity. The cure for these things is trust in Allah (*tawakkul*) and correctness of intention (*niyyah*).

Allah the Almighty says:

> **وَمَن يَتَوَكَّلْ عَلَى اللَّهِ فَهُوَ حَسْبُهُ**
>
> *"And whoever relies upon Allah - then He is sufficient for him."*
> — Quran, 65:3

**Translation:** And whoever trusts in Allah, then Allah is sufficient for him.

The Noble Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him) said:

> **إِنَّمَا الأَعْمَالُ بِالنِّيَّاتِ**
>
> *"Actions are but by intentions."*
> — Bukhari, Hadith 1

Some officers are also good, even some are purely religious, and some are regular disciples of a spiritual guide, but this is very rare. Some officers are psychologically victims of an inferiority complex. Their style of conversation and status become a problem. Naturalness is lost. Their focus on their economic class and a mere "decking" [show-off] towards the lower class dominates. Instead of a greeting (*salam*), the desire for a salute and to gain regard haunts them. They are very worried that someone might call them "backward." Due to their specific environment, some do not make their women observe the veil, and some start drinking alcohol, as a result of which they face internal complications. They also get fed up with this environment, but due to their distance from the other class, they do not turn towards the real cure. The cure for all these weaknesses is realism. Frequent visits to the graveyard and contact with a dervish are necessary.

The psychology of a subordinate is that the officer should not get angry, otherwise his salary will be stopped.

[p. 429]

I will be fired from my job, and my promotion will be stopped. Sometimes, one has to do the officer's legitimate and illegitimate tasks. Subordinates often curse their officers behind their backs and are displeased with them. The cure for this is to serve with honesty and to trust in Allah.

May Allah, the Glorious, grant us the ability to be realistic and make this brief writing of this humble servant beneficial for His creation. This is not difficult for Him.

> **وَمَا عَلَيْنَا إِلَّا الْبَلَاغُ**
>
> *"And upon us is only the [clear] notification."*

And may Allah's peace and blessings be upon Muhammad and his family.
