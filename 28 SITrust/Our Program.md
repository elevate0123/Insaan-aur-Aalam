## Overview
`The closest relationship a person will ever experience in their lifetime is with their spouse.` One embarks on a new journey (and sometimes into the uncharted territories) with the initiation of a Nikah. Additionally, an ideal marriage  is the focal point where higher moral teachings of Islam are manifested. 
Marriages are common, marriages are everywhere, but the essential requirement is to have a beautiful, loving, caring, happy, *successful marriage based on the Prophetic ideals*. This program is designed to directly hand you over the Prophetic Keys for a successful marriage.
