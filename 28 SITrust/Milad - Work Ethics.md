Incredible Human Rights Lessons from Prophets Last Sermon

Upholding Human Dignity
“Hurt no one so that no one may hurt you.”
Reminds to introspect and protect others as a way of protecting ourselves. The deeper lesson here is of Taqwa, being mindful of ones impact and knowing the rights of others is to be free from harm

Eliminating Discrimination
“All humankind is from Adam and Hawa. An Arab has no superiority over a non- Arab, nor does a non-Arab have superiority over an Arab; also a white has no superiority over a black, nor a black has any superiority over a white - except by piety and good action."
We are reminded of our origins and redirected to show love and care for one another, with a pure intent to benefit the humankind. 

Banishing Gender inequity
“I enjoin you to treat women well and be kind to them”
Emphasised the principles of mutual love, trust and respect. Indeed women and men are partners and complement one another. There is a need to understand each other and be kind to one another to create a harmonious living environment.

Avoiding Economic Inequality
“And give (some part of) your wealth in Zakat (Obligatory Charity)”
The practice of Zakat will ideally create a more just society through this wealth-sharing mechanism to achieve a fairer distribution of wealth and for the socio-economic development of the community. This is also a way to free ourselves from the bondage of desires

To delegitimize the Messenger ﷺ is to call into question the entire message.
Today, he is insulted with other labels. But perhaps the most invidious insult, designed to undermine the powerful establishment and spread of his message, is that he overcame his foes with terror only to rule them with cruelty
Islam as a whole, through these depictions, is seen as either a religion of peace or a religion of war, depending on which interpretation of the messenger and message is followed.
Modern critiques of some of the Prophet ﷺ’s undertakings are meant to question the civility of Islam in the ongoing manufactured clash of civilizations that fuel both Islamophobes and extremists.
By portraying the Prophet ﷺ himself as a barbarian, surely his followers must also be treated as an inherently violent political body that will employ any means necessary to achieve global domination.
The torrential downpour of allegations about Allah’s Messenger ﷺ using violence to force conversions, or being an unprincipled opportunist, are ultimately forcing us to rediscover his character anew


Any impartial reader of the Prophet ﷺ’s biography will quickly discover which “snapshots” taken from his life are dishonest in their representation, which were depictions of his normative practices, and which were exceptions to the norm. In fact, as one reads further, one realizes that even these “exceptions” were not trivial hiccups in his character, but rather another dimension of his superior persona and universal mercy that many simply fail to understand.




“I have come only to perfect the noble traits of character,” he ﷺ declared.


It is no wonder that countless sketches of the Prophet’s ﷺ physical and moral person have been composed throughout Islamic history in every imaginable language and idiom. In his classic treatise _Iḥyāʾ ʿulūm al-dīn_, Imam Abū Ḥāmid al-Ghazālī (d. 505 AH/CE 1111) includes an entire section in the second quarter, “Book of Etiquette of Life and the Prophetic Character,” which reproduces several moving and detailed descriptions of the Prophet’s ﷺ character composed by earlier scholars. This, in my opinion, is the noblest section of this epochal text. The entire chapter is worth reading, but space allows us to quote only a small fraction.

Frequently, the Prophet’s ﷺ conduct is so lofty that it appears inaccessible to most mortals. But his life is also full of anecdotes of simple, emulable acts of kindness to inspire anyone

With that, we hope and pray that these seventy incidents, paraphrased for the sake of conciseness, serve as a reminder of who the Prophet ﷺ really was: a man of mercy and moral greatness who sought not the praise of this world, but its betterment through his example.

[You Must Know This Man - Muhammad(The Ideal Prophet) (iium.edu.my)](https://www.iium.edu.my/deed/articles/muhammad.html)

**M.K Gandhi, statement published in "Young India," 1924**
I wanted to know the best of the life of one who holds today an undisputed sway over the hearts of millions of mankind..........I became more than ever convinced that it was not the sword that won a place for Islam in those days in the scheme of life. It was the rigid simplicity, the utter self-effacement of the Prophet, the scrupulous regard for pledges, his intense devotion to his friends and followers, his intrepidity, his fearlessness, his absolute trust in God and his mission.
These and not the sword carried everything before them and surmounted every obstacle. When I closed the second volume (of the Prophet's biography), I was sorry there was no more for me to read of that great life."

**Annie Besant:**
"It is impossible for anyone who studies the life and character of the great prophet of Arabia, who knows how he taught and how he lived, to feel anything but reverence for that mighty Prophet, one of the great messengers of the Supreme. And although in what I put to you I shall say many things which may be familiar to many, yet I myself feel whenever I re-read them, a new way of admiration, a new of reverence for that mighty Arabian teacher."  
**The Life and Teachings of Muhammad, Madras 1932, page 4**

 The implied equality in Al-Ghazali’s golden rule ethics provides a theological basis within classical Islam for a common understanding of basic modern human rights and interfaith cooperation on mutual global challenges like climate change and fair economic development. Appreciation for Al-Ghazali’s golden rule may also help non-Muslims better empathize with their fellow Muslim citizens and potentially reduce the grassroots hostility towards Islam that is the product of Internet misinformation and heated political rhetoric.
