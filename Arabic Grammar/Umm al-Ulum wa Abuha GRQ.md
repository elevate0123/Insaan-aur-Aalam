# Quranic Grammar: A Modern Sharah of Umm al-Ulum

## 0.0 Introduction

### 0.1 Welcome & How to Use This Book

1.  **Purpose:** This book is a comprehensive, structured, and accessible pathway to understanding the grammar of the Quran and Classical Arabic.
2.  **Source Text:** Our primary reference is the excellent Urdu work **`أم العلوم وأبوها` (Umm al-Ulum wa Abuha)** by Peer Ghulam Rasool Qasmi Naqshbandi.
3.  **Methodology:** We will follow the structure and depth of the source text but enhance it with modern pedagogical techniques:
    1.  **Inductive Learning:** We often start with Quranic examples to see a concept in action *before* learning the formal rule.
    2.  **Clear English:** We will explain all concepts in simple, modern English, defining every Arabic term.
    3.  **Structured Notes:** Each topic is a self-contained chapter, designed for clarity and easy navigation.
    4.  **Integration:** We will connect the "mother" science of `علم الصرف` (`Ilm al-Sarf`) - Morphology and the "father" science of `علم النحو` (`Ilm al-Nahw`) - Syntax from the very beginning to provide a holistic understanding.

## 1.0 The Building Blocks of Arabic

### 1.1 The Three Types of Words (`أقسام الكلمة` - Aqsām al-Kalimah)

> [!NOTE] Core Concept
> Every word in the Arabic language is classified into one of three fundamental categories: a noun (`اسم` - Ism), a verb (`فعل` - Fi'l), or a particle (`حرف` - Harf). This classification is exhaustive and mutually exclusive.

#### 1.1.1 Quranic Hooks

The following verses from the Quran demonstrate these three word types in context.

> [!QUOTE] Quranic Example 1 (Surah Al-Fatiha, 1:1)
> **بِسْمِ اللَّهِ الرَّحْمَٰنِ الرَّحِيمِ**
> *In the name of Allah, the Entirely Merciful, the Especially Merciful.*
>
> **Analysis:**
> *   `بِـ` (bi-) → **Particle** (`حرف`)
> *   `اسْمِ` (ismi) → **Noun** (`اسم`)
> *   `اللَّهِ` (Allāhi) → **Noun** (`اسم`)

> [!QUOTE] Quranic Example 2 (Surah Al-Ikhlas, 112:1)
> **قُلْ هُوَ اللَّهُ أَحَدٌ**
> *Say, "He is Allah, [who is] One."*
>
> **Analysis:**
> *   `قُلْ` (qul) → **Verb** (`فعل`)
> *   `هُوَ` (huwa) → **Noun** (`اسم`)
> *   `اللَّهُ` (Allāhu) → **Noun** (`اسم`)
> *   `أَحَدٌ` (aḥadun) → **Noun** (`اسم`)

#### 1.1.2 Detailed Explanation

The `كلمة` (kalimah), or the word, is the smallest unit of meaning in Arabic. Its three categories are defined as follows.

```mermaid
graph TD
    subgraph The Word الكلمة
        A[Ism - اسم<br>Noun<br><i>Meaning without Tense</i>]
        B[Fi'l - فعل<br>Verb<br><i>Meaning with Tense</i>]
        C[Harf - حرف<br>Particle<br><i>Needs other words for meaning</i>]
    end
```

##### 1. The Noun (`اسم` - Ism)
An `Ism` is a word that denotes a meaning in itself and is not bound by tense.

1.  **Scope of the `Ism`:**
    1.  **Entities:** `رَجُلٌ` (rajulun - a man), `مَكَّةُ` (Makkatu - Makkah), `كِتَابٌ` (kitābun - a book)
    2.  **Attributes (Adjectives):** `جَمِيلٌ` (jamīlun - beautiful), `عَظِيمٌ` (`aẓīmun` - great)
    3.  **Abstract Concepts:** `عِلْمٌ` (`ilmun` - knowledge), `إِيمَانٌ` (īmānun - faith)
    4.  **Pronouns:** `هُوَ` (huwa - he), `أَنْتَ` (anta - you)
    5.  **Adverbs & More:** The category of `Ism` is broad and includes words that function as adverbs, demonstratives, and relative pronouns.

2.  **Signs of an `Ism` (`علامات الاسم` - `Alāmāt al-Ism`):**
    A word is definitively an `Ism` if it exhibits any of the following properties:
    1.  **Acceptance of the Definite Article `ال` (al-):** The ability to be made definite. Example: `بَيْتٌ` (a house) becomes `الْبَيْتُ` (the house).
    2.  **Acceptance of `تنوين` (Tanween):** The ability to carry the double vowel markings at the end (`-un`, `-an`, `-in`), which typically signifies indefiniteness. Example: `كِتَابٌ`.
    3.  **Acceptance of a Preceding `حرف جر` (Harf Jarr):** The ability to be governed by a preposition. In the phrase `مِنَ السَّمَاءِ` (from the sky), `السَّمَاءِ` is an `Ism` because it follows the preposition `مِنْ`.

##### 2. The Verb (`فعل` - Fi'l)
A `Fi'l` is a word that denotes a meaning in itself and is bound to a specific tense.

1.  **The Three Tenses:**
    1.  **Past (`الماضي` - al-Māḍī):** An action completed. Example: `خَلَقَ` (khalaqa - He created).
    2.  **Present/Future (`المضارع` - al-Muḍāriʿ):** An ongoing or future action. Example: `يَعْلَمُ` (yaʿlamu - He knows).
    3.  **Command (`الأمر` - al-Amr):** A request or command. Example: `اقْرَأْ` (iqra' - Read!).

2.  **Signs of a `Fi'l` (`علامات الفعل` - `Alāmāt al-Fi'l`):**
    A word is definitively a `Fi'l` if it can be preceded by one of the following particles:
    1.  **`قَدْ` (qad):** Indicates certainty or completion ("has/had already"). Example: `قَدْ سَمِعَ اللَّهُ` (Allah has indeed heard).
    2.  **`سَـ` (sa-) or `سَوْفَ` (sawfa):** Indicates the future ("will/shall"). Example: `سَيَعْلَمُونَ` (They will know).

##### 3. The Particle (`حرف` - Harf)
A `Harf` is a word whose meaning is incomplete on its own and is only understood in relation to other words in a sentence.

1.  **Function:** Its primary role is to connect `Ism`s and `Fi'l`s or to add a specific functional meaning to the sentence (e.g., emphasis, negation, questioning).
2.  **Examples by Function:**
    *   **Connecting:** `وَ` (and), `فَـ` (then)
    *   **Location/Relation (`حروف الجر`):** `فِي` (in), `عَلَى` (on), `إِلَى` (to)
    *   **Emphasis:** `إِنَّ` (indeed), `لَـ` (verily)
3.  **Identification:** A `Harf` is identified by the **absence** of the signs of an `Ism` or a `Fi'l`. It is a closed class of words that must be memorized.

#### 1.1.3 Bridging Concepts

*   The study of how `Ism`s and `Fi'l`s are formed and derived from root letters is **`علم الصرف` (`Ilm al-Sarf`)**.
*   The study of how `Ism`s, `Fi'l`s, and `Harf`s interact within a sentence and the rules governing their case endings is **`علم النحو` (`Ilm al-Nahw`)**.

#### 1.1.4 [[Umm al-Ulum Ref]]

This topic is foundational and is discussed on **page 7** of the source text under the heading `ابتدائ صرف`. The author provides the basic definitions and examples in Urdu.

#### 1.1.5 Quick Revision Scaffold

| Word Type | Meaning | Tense | Key Sign | Example |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **`اسم` (Ism)** | Independent | No | Accepts `ال` or `Tanween` | `الْكِتَابُ` |
| **`فعل` (Fi'l)** | Independent | Yes | Can be preceded by `قَدْ` | `قَدْ خَلَقَ` |
| **`حرف` (Harf)**| Relational | No | Accepts none of the above | `فِي` |

#### 1.1.6 Quranic Exercises

**Task:** For each verse, create a table identifying every word and its type.

1.  > **وَجَاءَ مِنْ أَقْصَى الْمَدِينَةِ رَجُلٌ يَسْعَىٰ** (Surah Ya-Sin, 36:20)  
    > *And there came from the farthest end of the city a man, running.*

2.  > **إِنَّ مَعَ الْعُسْرِ يُسْرًا** (Surah Ash-Sharh, 94:6)  
    > *Indeed, with hardship [will be] ease.*

### 1.2 The Four Properties of a Noun (`خصائص الاسم` - Khaṣā'iṣ al-Ism)

> [!NOTE] Core Concept
> Every `اسم` (Ism) in Arabic has four fundamental properties that must be known to understand its function in a sentence: **Status** (Case), **Number**, **Gender**, and **Type** (Definiteness).

#### 1.2.1 Quranic Hooks

Observe the word `كِتَاب` (kitāb - book) in these two verses. Notice how its form and ending change based on its role.

> [!QUOTE] Quranic Example 1 (Surah Al-Baqarah, 2:2)
> **ذَٰلِكَ الْكِتَابُ لَا رَيْبَ فِيهِ**
> *That is the Book, wherein is no doubt.*
>
> **Analysis:** Here, `الْكِتَابُ` (al-kitābu) ends with a `dammah` (ـُ). It is the subject of a thought.

> [!QUOTE] Quranic Example 2 (Surah Al-Kahf, 18:1)
> **الْحَمْدُ لِلَّهِ الَّذِي أَنزَلَ عَلَىٰ عَبْدِهِ الْكِتَابَ**
> *Praise be to Allah, who has sent down upon His Servant the Book.*
>
> **Analysis:** Here, `الْكِتَابَ` (al-kitāba) ends with a `fathah` (ـَ). It is the object of the verb "sent down".

The change from `kitābu` to `kitāba` is due to its **Status**. This is one of the four properties we will explore.

#### 1.2.2 Detailed Explanation

To parse any sentence correctly, one must be able to describe any `Ism` within it using these four attributes.

    B --> B1 & B2 & B3;
    C --> C1 & C2 & C3;
    D --> D1 & D2;
    E --> E1 & E2;
```

##### 1. Status (`الإعراب` - al-I'rāb)
This is the most important property. It indicates the grammatical function of the noun in a sentence (e.g., is it the subject, the object, or something else?). It is shown by the vowel ending of the word.

1.  **Nominative Case (`مرفوع` - Marfū'):** The "doer" or subject case. The default state of a noun.
    *   **Sign:** Often ends in a `dammah` (ـُ) or `dammahtain` (ـٌ).
    *   **Example:** `جَاءَ رَجُلٌ` (jā'a rajul**un** - A man came). `رَجُلٌ` is the doer.

2.  **Accusative Case (`منصوب` - Manṣūb):** The "detail" or object case. Often indicates the object of a verb.
    *   **Sign:** Often ends in a `fathah` (ـَ) or `fathatain` (ـً).
    *   **Example:** `رَأَيْتُ رَجُلًا` (ra'aytu rajul**an** - I saw a man). `رَجُلًا` is the object.

3.  **Genitive Case (`مجرور` - Majrūr):** The possessive case. Occurs after a preposition or as the second word in a possessive phrase.
    *   **Sign:** Often ends in a `kasrah` (ـِ) or `kasratain` (ـٍ).
    *   **Example:** `مَرَرْتُ بِرَجُلٍ` (marartu bi-rajul**in** - I passed by a man). `رَجُلٍ` is the object of the preposition `بِـ`.

##### 2. Number (`العدد` - al-`Adad`)
This indicates whether the noun is singular, dual, or plural.

1.  **Singular (`مفرد` - Mufrad):** Refers to one. Example: `مُسْلِمٌ` (a Muslim).
2.  **Dual (`مثنى` - Muthannā):** Refers to two. Formed by adding `ـَانِ` (in the `Marfu'` state) or `ـَيْنِ` (in the `Mansub/Majrur` states) to the singular. Example: `مُسْلِمَانِ` (two Muslims).
3.  **Plural (`جمع` - Jam`):** Refers to three or more. This is the most complex category and has two main types:
    *   **Sound Plural (`جمع سالم`):** The original singular word remains intact.
        *   Masculine: Add `ـُونَ` (`Marfu'`) or `ـِينَ` (`Mansub/Majrur`). Example: `مُسْلِمُونَ` (Muslims).
        *   Feminine: Add `ـَاتٌ` (`Marfu'`) or `ـَاتٍ` (`Mansub/Majrur`). Example: `مُسْلِمَاتٌ` (Muslim women).
    *   **Broken Plural (`جمع تكسير`):** The singular form is "broken" and rearranged to form the plural. These must be memorized. Example: `كِتَاب` (book) → `كُتُب` (books).

##### 3. Gender (`الجنس` - al-Jins)
Every noun in Arabic is either masculine or feminine. There is no neuter gender.

1.  **Masculine (`مذكر` - Mudhakkar):** This is the default gender. Any noun is masculine unless there is a reason for it to be feminine.
2.  **Feminine (`مؤنث` - Mu'annath):** A noun is feminine if it:
    *   Refers to a female being: `أُمٌّ` (mother), `بِنْتٌ` (daughter).
    *   Ends in the primary sign of femininity, the **`ة` (Tā' Marbūṭah)**. Example: `سَيَّارَةٌ` (a car).
    *   Is a body part that comes in pairs: `يَدٌ` (hand), `عَيْنٌ` (eye).
    *   Is a name of a country or tribe: `مِصْرُ` (Egypt).
    *   Is considered feminine by convention (Sama'i Feminine), e.g., `شَمْسٌ` (sun), `نَارٌ` (fire), `أَرْضٌ` (earth).

##### 4. Type (`النوع` - al-Naw`)
This property, also called definiteness, indicates whether the noun is specific or general.

1.  **Indefinite (`نكرة` - Nakirah):** A general, unspecified noun.
    *   **Sign:** Usually has `Tanween` at the end.
    *   **Example:** `كِتَابٌ` (a book).

2.  **Definite (`معرفة` - Ma`rifah):** A specific, known noun. There are several categories of definite nouns:
    *   Nouns with the definite article `ال`: `الْكِتَابُ` (the book).
    *   Proper Nouns: `مُحَمَّدٌ`, `مَكَّةُ`.
    *   Pronouns: `هُوَ`, `هِيَ`, `أَنَا`.
    *   Demonstrative Pronouns: `هَٰذَا` (this), `ذَٰلِكَ` (that).
    *   The first part of a possessive phrase (`Idafa`): The word `بَابُ` (door) in `بَابُ الْبَيْتِ` (the door *of the house*) is definite because it is specified by `الْبَيْتِ`.

#### 1.2.3 Bridging Concepts

*   The interplay between **Status** and **Number** is critical. The ending that shows a noun is `Marfu'` is different for singular (`-un`), dual (`-āni`), and sound masculine plural (`-ūna`). Mastering this is key to `Nahw`.
*   **Gender** and **Number** agreement between nouns and verbs is a core feature of Arabic sentences. A feminine plural subject will require a corresponding feminine plural verb.

#### 1.2.4 [[Umm al-Ulum Ref]]

The source text introduces these concepts in a distributed manner.
*   **Gender and Number** are implicitly discussed through the `Sarf` tables starting from **page 12**.
*   **Status (I'rab)** is the core topic of the `Nahw` section, starting from **page 47**, where the author discusses the `Marfu'`, `Mansub`, and `Majrur` states.
*   **Type (Definiteness)** is discussed implicitly throughout. Our note consolidates these four properties into a single, foundational framework for easier comprehension.

> 1.  **Status:** Is it `Marfu'` (subject), `Mansub` (object), or `Majrur` (possessive)?
> 2.  **Number:** Is it Singular, Dual, or Plural?
> 3.  **Gender:** Is it Masculine or Feminine?
> 4.  **Type:** Is it Definite or Indefinite?
>
> **Example Analysis:** The word `الْمُسْلِمُونَ` in `جَاءَ الْمُسْلِمُونَ` (The Muslims came).
> *   **Status:** `Marfu'` (it is the doer of the verb `جَاءَ`).
> *   **Number:** Plural (Sound Masculine Plural).
> *   **Gender:** Masculine.
> *   **Type:** Definite (because of `ال`).

#### 1.2.6 Quranic Exercises

**Task:** Analyze the highlighted nouns in the following verses by identifying their four properties.

1.  > **خَلَقَ اللَّهُ السَّمَاوَاتِ بِالْحَقِّ** (Surah Al-Ankabut, 29:44)
    > *Allah created the heavens in truth.*
    > **Analyze:** `اللَّهُ` and `السَّمَاوَاتِ`.

2.  > **فِيهِمَا عَيْنَانِ تَجْرِيَانِ** (Surah Ar-Rahman, 55:50)
    > *In both of them are two springs, flowing.*
    > **Analyze:** `عَيْنَانِ`.

**Answers to Exercises:**

1.  **Verse 1 Analysis (Surah Al-Ankabut, 29:44):**
    *   **`اللَّهُ` (Allāhu):**
        *   Status: `Marfu'` (Subject/doer of the verb `خَلَقَ`).
        *   Number: Singular.
        *   Gender: Masculine.
        *   Type: Definite (Proper Noun).
    *   **`السَّمَاوَاتِ` (al-samāwāti):**
        *   Status: `Mansub` (Object of the verb `خَلَقَ`). *Note: The `kasrah` (ـِ) is a special sign for the `Mansub` case in feminine sound plurals, a topic we will cover later.*
        *   Number: Plural (Feminine Sound Plural).
        *   Gender: Feminine (by convention).
        *   Type: Definite (due to `ال`).

2.  **Verse 2 Analysis (Surah Ar-Rahman, 55:50):**
    *   **`عَيْنَانِ` (`aynāni`):**
        *   Status: `Marfu'` (It is the delayed subject of the sentence).
        *   Number: Dual.
        *   Gender: Feminine (body part in a pair).
        *   Type: Indefinite (no `ال`).

Excellent. Having established the three word types and the four properties of a noun, we can now formally construct our first sentence type: the nominal sentence. This chapter will build directly on the concepts from the previous one.

### 1.3 The Nominal Sentence (`الجملة الإسمية` - al-Jumlah al-Ismiyyah)

> [!NOTE] Core Concept
> A `الجملة الإسمية` (Jumlah Ismiyyah) is a sentence that begins with a noun (`Ism`). It conveys a complete thought without necessarily using a verb, typically to state a fact or describe a quality. Its two core components are the **Subject** (`المبتدأ`) and the **Predicate** (`الخبر`).

#### 1.3.1 Quranic Hooks

These verses are perfect examples of nominal sentences, stating profound truths.

> [!QUOTE] Quranic Example 1 (Surah Al-Baqarah, 2:255)
> **اللَّهُ لَا إِلَٰهَ إِلَّا هُوَ الْحَيُّ الْقَيُّومُ**
> *Allah - there is no deity except Him, the Ever-Living, the Self-Sustaining.*
>
> **Analysis:** The sentence begins with the `Ism` `اللَّهُ`, making it a `Jumlah Ismiyyah`. The rest of the verse provides information about Him.

> [!QUOTE] Quranic Example 2 (Surah Al-Hujurat, 49:10)
> **إِنَّمَا الْمُؤْمِنُونَ إِخْوَةٌ**
> *The believers are but brothers.*
>
> **Analysis:** The core of this sentence is `الْمُؤْمِنُونَ إِخْوَةٌ` (The believers are brothers). It starts with the `Ism` `الْمُؤْمِنُونَ`.

> [!QUOTE] Quranic Example 3 (Surah Al-Ma'idah, 5:1)
> **أُحِلَّتْ لَكُم بَهِيمَةُ الْأَنْعَامِ**
> *Lawful for you are the animals of grazing livestock...*
>
> **Analysis:** This is a trick! This sentence begins with `أُحِلَّتْ`, which is a verb (`Fi'l`). Therefore, this is a **Verbal Sentence**, not a Nominal Sentence. Recognizing the first word is key.

#### 1.3.2 Detailed Explanation

The `Jumlah Ismiyyah` is the foundation of descriptive statements in Arabic. It is defined by its two pillars (`ركنان`).

```mermaid
graph TD
    subgraph The Nominal Sentence الجملة الإسمية
        A[Mubtada' - المبتدأ<br>The Subject] --> B[Khabar - الخبر<br>The Predicate];
    end

    style A fill:#e6f3ff,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px
    style B fill:#e6ffe6,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px
```

##### 1. The Subject (`المبتدأ` - al-Mubtada')
The `Mubtada'` (literally, "the thing which is begun with") is the noun the sentence is about.

1.  **Default State:** It is always in the **Nominative Case (`مرفوع` - Marfū')**. This is its non-negotiable status.
2.  **Definiteness:** It is typically **Definite (`معرفة` - Ma`rifah)**. You usually start a sentence by talking about something specific.
3.  **Position:** It usually comes at the beginning of the sentence.

##### 2. The Predicate (`الخبر` - al-Khabar)
The `Khabar` (literally, "the news") is the part of the sentence that provides information about the `Mubtada'`.

1.  **Default State:** It is also always in the **Nominative Case (`مرفوع` - Marfū')**.
2.  **Definiteness:** It is typically **Indefinite (`نكرة` - Nakirah)**. This contrast in definiteness between the `Mubtada'` and `Khabar` is a strong signal of the sentence structure.
3.  **Agreement:** The `Khabar` must agree with the `Mubtada'` in **Number** and **Gender**.

#### 1.3.3 The Agreement Rules in Action

This agreement is a crucial feature of the `Jumlah Ismiyyah`.

| Example Sentence | Mubtada' (Subject) | Khabar (Predicate) | Agreement | Translation |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `الْمُسْلِمُ صَادِقٌ` | Singular, Masculine | Singular, Masculine | Match | The Muslim is truthful. |
| `الْمُسْلِمَةُ صَادِقَةٌ` | Singular, Feminine | Singular, Feminine | Match | The Muslim woman is truthful. |
| `الْمُسْلِمَانِ صَادِقَانِ` | Dual, Masculine | Dual, Masculine | Match | The two Muslims are truthful. |
| `الْمُسْلِمُونَ صَادِقُونَ` | Plural, Masculine | Plural, Masculine | Match | The Muslims are truthful. |
| `الْمُسْلِمَاتُ صَادِقَاتٌ` | Plural, Feminine | Plural, Feminine | Match | The Muslim women are truthful. |

> [!TIP] The "is/am/are" is understood. The core formula is:
> **Definite `Marfu'` Noun + Indefinite `Marfu'` Noun = "A is B"**

#### 1.3.4 Types of Predicate (`أنواع الخبر` - Anwā` al-Khabar)
While the `Mubtada'` is always a noun (or pronoun), the `Khabar` can be more complex.

1.  **A Single Word (`مفرد` - Mufrad):** As seen in all the examples above. `الْكِتَابُ جَدِيدٌ` (The book is new).
2.  **A Nominal Sentence (`جملة اسمية`):** The predicate itself can be a full `Mubtada'-Khabar` sentence.
    *   Example: `زَيْدٌ أَبُوهُ عَالِمٌ` (Zayd, his father is a scholar). Here, `زَيْدٌ` is the first `Mubtada'`. The entire sentence `أَبُوهُ عَالِمٌ` is the `Khabar`.
3.  **A Verbal Sentence (`جملة فعلية`):** The predicate can be a verb and its subject.
    *   Example: `اللَّهُ خَلَقَ السَّمَاوَاتِ` (Allah created the heavens). `اللَّهُ` is the `Mubtada'`. The verbal sentence `خَلَقَ السَّمَاوَاتِ` is the `Khabar`.
4.  **A "Quasi-Sentence" (`شبه جملة` - Shibh Jumlah):** The predicate can be a prepositional phrase (`Harf Jarr` + `Ism Majrur`) or an adverbial phrase.
    *   Example: `الْحَمْدُ لِلَّهِ` (The praise is for Allah). `الْحَمْدُ` is the `Mubtada'`. The prepositional phrase `لِلَّهِ` is the `Khabar`.

#### 1.3.5 [[Umm al-Ulum Ref]]

The author discusses the components of a sentence on **page 48**. He uses the classical terms `مسند إليه` (musnad ilayh - that to which something is assigned) and `مسند` (musnad - that which is assigned).
*   In a `Jumlah Ismiyyah`, the `المبتدأ` is the `مسند إليه`.
*   The `الخبر` is the `مسند`.
This framework is powerful and highlights the logical relationship between the two parts of the sentence.

#### 1.3.6 Quick Revision Scaffold

> [!SUMMARY] Anatomy of a Nominal Sentence
> 1.  **Starts with:** An `Ism`.
> 2.  **Pillar 1: `المبتدأ` (Subject)**
>     *   **Status:** `Marfu'` (Nominative)
>     *   **Type:** Definite

>     *   **Status:** `Marfu'` (Nominative)
>     *   **Type:** Indefinite
> 4.  **Agreement:** The `Khabar` must match the `Mubtada'` in Gender and Number.

#### 1.3.7 Quranic Exercises

**Task:** Identify the `Mubtada'` and `Khabar` in the following verses. Also, state the type of `Khabar` (Single Word, Nominal Sentence, Verbal Sentence, or Quasi-Sentence).

1.  > **وَاللَّهُ غَفُورٌ رَّحِيمٌ** (Surah Al-Baqarah, 2:218)
    > *And Allah is Forgiving and Merciful.*

2.  > **أُولَٰئِكَ أَصْحَابُ النَّارِ** (Surah Al-Baqarah, 2:39)
    > *Those are the companions of the Fire.*

3.  > **الْجَنَّةُ تَحْتَ أَقْدَامِ الْأُمَّهَاتِ** (This is a famous saying, often attributed as a Hadith)
    > *Paradise is under the feet of mothers.*

**Answers to Exercises:**

1.  **Verse 1 Analysis:**
    *   **Mubtada':** `اللَّهُ`
    *   **Khabar:** `غَفُورٌ` (A single word). `رَّحِيمٌ` is a second `Khabar`.

2.  **Verse 2 Analysis:**
    *   **Mubtada':** `أُولَٰئِكَ` (Those - a demonstrative pronoun, which is a definite `Ism`).
    *   **Khabar:** `أَصْحَابُ النَّارِ` (The companions of the Fire - a possessive phrase functioning as the predicate). This is considered a single-word type of `Khabar` in many grammatical analyses, as the core is the word `أَصْحَابُ`.

3.  **Saying Analysis:**
    *   **Mubtada':** `الْجَنَّةُ`
    *   **Khabar:** `تَحْتَ أَقْدَامِ الْأُمَّهَاتِ` (under the feet of mothers). This is a **Quasi-Sentence (`Shibh Jumlah`)** because it is an adverbial phrase of place.

Perfect. We will now move to the second fundamental sentence type, the Verbal Sentence. This chapter will introduce the core components of an action-based sentence and set the stage for a deeper dive into verb morphology (`Sarf`).

---
---

### 1.4 The Verbal Sentence (`الجملة الفعلية` - al-Jumlah al-Fi'liyyah)

> [!NOTE] Core Concept
> A `الجملة الفعلية` (Jumlah Fi'liyyah) is a sentence that begins with a verb (`فعل` - Fi'l). Its essential structure is built around an action and the one who performs it. Its minimum components are a **Verb** (`فعل`) and a **Subject/Doer** (`فاعل`).

#### 1.4.1 Quranic Hooks

These verses exemplify the direct, action-oriented nature of the verbal sentence.

> [!QUOTE] Quranic Example 1 (Surah Al-Fath, 48:1)
> **إِنَّا فَتَحْنَا لَكَ فَتْحًا مُّبِينًا**
> *Indeed, We have given you a clear victory.*
>
> **Analysis:** The core of this sentence is `فَتَحْنَا` (fataḥnā - We opened/gave victory). It begins with a verb, making it a `Jumlah Fi'liyyah`.

> [!QUOTE] Quranic Example 2 (Surah Abasa, 80:33)
> **فَإِذَا جَاءَتِ الصَّاخَّةُ**
> *But when there comes the Deafening Blast...*
>
> **Analysis:** The sentence structure here is `جَاءَتِ الصَّاخَّةُ` (jā'at-iṣ-ṣākhkhatu - the Deafening Blast came). It begins with the verb `جَاءَتِ`.

> [!QUOTE] Quranic Example 3 (Surah Al-Mulk, 67:1)
> **تَبَارَكَ الَّذِي بِيَدِهِ الْمُلْكُ**
> *Blessed is He in whose hand is dominion.*
>
> **Analysis:** The sentence begins with the verb `تَبَارَكَ` (tabāraka - He is blessed).

#### 1.4.2 Detailed Explanation

While the nominal sentence describes a state of being ("A is B"), the verbal sentence describes an action. It answers the question, "Who did what?"

```mermaid
graph TD
    subgraph The Verbal Sentence الجملة الفعلية
        A[Fi'l - فعل<br>The Verb] --> B[Fā'il - فاعل<br>The Subject/Doer];
        B --> C[Maf'ūl bihi - مفعول به<br>The Object Optional];
    end

    style A fill:#e6f3ff,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px
    style B fill:#e6ffe6,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px
    style C fill:#fff5e6,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px
```

##### 1. The Verb (`فعل` - Fi'l)
This is the first component and defines the sentence type. It can be in the past, present, or command form.

*   **Default Word Order:** The standard word order in a `Jumlah Fi'liyyah` is **Verb -> Subject -> Object**.

##### 2. The Subject / Doer (`فاعل` - Fā`il)
The `Fā'il` is the `Ism` that performs the action of the verb.

1.  **Status:** The `Fā'il` is **always** in the **Nominative Case (`مرفوع` - Marfū')**. This is its most critical feature. If you find a verb, look for the `Marfu'` noun after it—that is your doer.
2.  **Position:** It typically comes immediately after the verb.
3.  **Types of `Fā'il`:**
    *   **An Explicit Noun (`اسم ظاهر`):** A visible noun.
        *   Example: `خَلَقَ اللَّهُ السَّمَاوَاتِ` (khalaqa **Allāhu** al-samāwāti - Allah created the heavens). `اللَّهُ` is the explicit `Fā'il`.
    *   **An Implied Pronoun (`ضمير مستتر`):** A hidden pronoun contained within the verb's conjugation.
        *   Example: `خَلَقَ السَّمَاوَاتِ` (khalaqa al-samāwāti - **He** created the heavens). If `اللَّهُ` were not mentioned, the `Fā'il` would be the pronoun "He" (`هُوَ`), which is understood from the verb form `خَلَقَ`.

##### 3. The Object (`مفعول به` - Maf`ūl bihi)
The `Maf'ūl bihi` is the `Ism` upon which the action of the verb is done. It is the "receiver" of the action.

1.  **Status:** The `Maf'ūl bihi` is **always** in the **Accusative Case (`منصوب` - Manṣūb)**.
2.  **Necessity:** It is an optional component. Not all verbs require an object.
    *   **Transitive Verb (`فعل متعد`):** A verb that needs an object to complete its meaning (e.g., to see, to create, to write).
    *   **Intransitive Verb (`فعل لازم`):** A verb that does not need an object (e.g., to sit, to sleep, to go). Example: `جَلَسَ الْوَلَدُ` (jalasa al-waladu - The boy sat). This is a complete sentence with no object.

#### 1.4.3 The Agreement Rules

The rules for agreement between the verb and its subject are precise.

1.  **Gender Agreement:** The verb **always** agrees with the `Fā'il` in gender.
    *   `قَالَ رَجُلٌ` (A man said) - Masculine verb for masculine `Fā'il`.
    *   `قَالَتِ امْرَأَةٌ` (A woman said) - Feminine verb for feminine `Fā'il`.

2.  **Number Agreement:** This is a key difference from English.
    *   **Rule:** When the `Fā'il` is an **explicit noun** (`اسم ظاهر`) that comes *after* the verb, the verb **always remains in its singular form**, regardless of whether the `Fā'il` is singular, dual, or plural.
    *   **Correct:** `جَاءَ الْمُسْلِمُ` (The Muslim came).
    *   **Correct:** `جَاءَ الْمُسْلِمَانِ` (The two Muslims came).
    *   **Correct:** `جَاءَ الْمُسْلِمُونَ` (The Muslims came).
    *   **Incorrect:** `جَاءُوا الْمُسْلِمُونَ`. The verb does not become plural here.

#### 1.4.4 [[Umm al-Ulum Ref]]

The author introduces the verbal sentence on **page 48**, contrasting it with the nominal sentence. The concepts of `فاعل` (Fā'il) and `مفعول` (Maf'ūl) are central to the entire `Nahw` section. The `Fā'il` is listed as the first type of `Marfu'` word, and the `Maf'ūl bihi` is the first type of `Mansub` word, highlighting their primary importance.

#### 1.4.5 Quick Revision Scaffold

> [!SUMMARY] Anatomy of a Verbal Sentence
> 1.  **Starts with:** A `Fi'l` (Verb).
> 2.  **Pillar 1: `فعل` (Verb)**
>     *   Defines the action and tense.
> 3.  **Pillar 2: `فاعل` (Subject/Doer)**
>     *   **Status:** Always `Marfu'` (Nominative).
>     *   Comes after the verb.
> 4.  **Optional Part: `مفعول به` (Object)**
>     *   **Status:** Always `Mansub` (Accusative).
>     *   Receives the action.
> 5.  **Key Rule:** The verb agrees with the subject in gender, but remains singular if the subject is an explicit noun following it.

#### 1.4.6 Quranic Exercises

**Task:** For each verse, identify the `Fi'l`, `Fā'il`, and `Maf'ūl bihi` (if present).

1.  > **وَخَلَقَ الْإِنسَانَ ضَعِيفًا** (Surah An-Nisa, 4:28)
    > *And mankind was created weak.* (Note: This is passive voice, a special case. The `Fā'il` is Allah, but is unstated. `الْإِنسَانَ` is the `نائب الفاعل` - deputy subject). Let's rephrase for this exercise: `خَلَقَ اللَّهُ الْإِنسَانَ` (Allah created man).

2.  > **يَوْمَ يَجْمَعُ اللَّهُ الرُّسُلَ** (Surah Al-Ma'idah, 5:109)
    > *[Mention, O Muhammad], the Day when Allah will gather the messengers.*

3.  > **قَدْ أَفْلَحَ الْمُؤْمِنُونَ** (Surah Al-Mu'minun, 23:1)
    > *The believers have certainly succeeded.*

**Answers to Exercises:**

1.  **Analysis of `خَلَقَ اللَّهُ الْإِنسَانَ`:**
    *   **Fi'l:** `خَلَقَ` (created)
    *   **Fā'il:** `اللَّهُ` (is `Marfu'`)
    *   **Maf'ūl bihi:** `الْإِنسَانَ` (is `Mansub'`)

2.  **Verse 2 Analysis:**
    *   **Fi'l:** `يَجْمَعُ` (will gather)
    *   **Fā'il:** `اللَّهُ` (is `Marfu'`)
    *   **Maf'ūl bihi:** `الرُّسُلَ` (is `Mansub'`)

3.  **Verse 3 Analysis:**
    *   **Fi'l:** `أَفْلَحَ` (have succeeded)
    *   **Fā'il:** `الْمُؤْمِنُونَ` (is `Marfu'`)
    *   **Maf'ūl bihi:** None. The verb `أَفْلَحَ` is intransitive (`لازم`).

---

Excellent. We have now covered the two fundamental sentence types. Before we can delve deeper into their complexities, we must formally establish the concept of **Status (`I'rāb`)**, which we have been referencing throughout. This chapter is the absolute heart of `Nahw` (Syntax).

---
---

### 1.5 Introduction to `I'rāb` (`الإعراب` - The System of Grammatical Cases)

> [!NOTE] Core Concept
> `الإعراب` (al-I'rāb) is the system of changing the ending of a word (primarily an `Ism` or a present tense `Fi'l`) to reflect its specific grammatical function within a sentence. This system is what brings precision and clarity to Arabic, removing the ambiguity that often requires extra words in other languages.

#### 1.5.1 Quranic Hooks

The following verses show the same word, `اللَّهُ`, in the three different cases of `I'rāb`. This is the clearest possible demonstration of the concept.

> [!QUOTE] Quranic Example 1: The Nominative Case (`مرفوع`)
> **قُلْ هُوَ اللَّهُ أَحَدٌ** (Surah Al-Ikhlas, 112:1)
> *Say, "He is **Allah**, [who is] One."*
>
> **Analysis:** Here, `اللَّهُ` (Allāh**u**) ends in a `dammah`. It is the predicate (`Khabar`) of the sentence and is therefore in the `Marfu'` state. It is the subject of the description.

> [!QUOTE] Quranic Example 2: The Accusative Case (`منصوب`)
> **إِنَّ اللَّهَ غَفُورٌ رَّحِيمٌ** (Surah Al-Baqarah, 2:173)
> *Indeed, **Allah** is Forgiving and Merciful.*
>
> **Analysis:** Here, `اللَّهَ` (Allāh**a**) ends in a `fathah`. The particle `إِنَّ` forces the noun after it into the `Mansub` state. It is the object of the emphasis.

> [!QUOTE] Quranic Example 3: The Genitive Case (`مجرور`)
> **آمَنَّا بِاللَّهِ** (Surah Al-Baqarah, 2:136)
> *We have believed in **Allah**.*
>
> **Analysis:** Here, `اللَّهِ` (Allāh**i**) ends in a `kasrah`. The preposition `بِـ` forces the noun after it into the `Majrur` state. It is the object of the preposition.

#### 1.5.2 Detailed Explanation

`I'rāb` is the system that tells us "who did what to whom." It is the engine of Arabic grammar. Every `Ism` that is not "fixed" (`مبني` - mabnī) will change its ending to show its status.

```mermaid
graph TD
    subgraph The Three Cases of I'rāb
        A[مرفوع<br>Marfū'<br>Nominative Case]
        B[منصوب<br>Manṣūb<br>Accusative Case]
        C[مجرور<br>Majrūr<br>Genitive Case]

    B -- "The Detail/Object" --> E{Function: Object of a verb<br>Specification};
    C -- "Possession/After Preposition" --> F{Function: Object of a preposition<br>Possession};
```

##### 1. The Nominative Case (`مرفوع` - Marfū')
This is the default case of a noun. A noun is `Marfu'` when it is the primary actor or subject of a sentence.

1.  **Primary Roles:**
    1.  The Subject of a Nominal Sentence (`المبتدأ` - Mubtada').
    2.  The Predicate of a Nominal Sentence (`الخبر` - Khabar).
    3.  The Doer of a Verb (`الفاعل` - Fā'il).
2.  **Default Sign:** For a singular noun, the sign is the `dammah` (ـُ) or `tanween dammah` (ـٌ).
    *   `الْبَيْتُ كَبِيرٌ` (The house is large). Both `الْبَيْتُ` and `كَبِيرٌ` are `Marfu'`.

##### 2. The Accusative Case (`منصوب` - Manṣūb)
A noun becomes `Mansub` when it is acted upon or when it provides circumstantial detail to an action.

1.  **Primary Roles:**
    1.  The Object of a Verb (`المفعول به` - Maf'ūl bihi).
    2.  Adverbs of time and place.
    3.  The noun following the particle `إِنَّ` and its "sisters".
2.  **Default Sign:** For a singular noun, the sign is the `fathah` (ـَ) or `tanween fathah` (ـً).
    *   `رَأَيْتُ الْبَيْتَ الْكَبِيرَ` (I saw the large house). `الْبَيْتَ` and `الْكَبِيرَ` are `Mansub'`.

##### 3. The Genitive Case (`مجرور` - Majrūr)
A noun becomes `Majrur` for one of two primary reasons.

1.  **Primary Roles:**
    1.  It is preceded by a preposition (`حرف جر`).
    2.  It is the possessor in a possessive phrase (`مضاف إليه` - Muḍāf Ilayh).
2.  **Default Sign:** For a singular noun, the sign is the `kasrah` (ـِ) or `tanween kasrah` (ـٍ).
    *   `نَظَرْتُ إِلَى بَابِ الْبَيْتِ` (I looked at the door of the house). `بَابِ` is `Majrur` because of `إِلَى`, and `الْبَيْتِ` is `Majrur` because it is the possessor.

#### 1.5.3 The Agents of Change (`العوامل` - al-`Awāmil)

What causes a noun to leave its default `Marfu'` state and become `Mansub` or `Majrur`? These causes are called **Agents (`عامل` - `āmil)**.

*   **The Agent is the "Why":** When you see a noun is `Mansub`, you must ask, "What is the agent that made it `Mansub`?" The answer might be, "It is the object of the verb `رَأَى`."
*   **No Agent = Default:** If there is no agent of change acting upon a noun, it remains in its default `Marfu'` state. This is why the `Mubtada'` is `Marfu'`.

| Sentence            | Noun       | Status   | Agent (`عامل`)                            |     |
| :------------------ | :--------- | :------- | :---------------------------------------- | :-- |
| `جَاءَ زَيْدٌ`      | `زَيْدٌ`   | `Marfu'` | The verb `جَاءَ` (made it the doer).      |     |
| `رَأَيْتُ زَيْدًا`  | `زَيْدًا`  | `Mansub` | The verb `رَأَيْتُ` (made it the object). |     |
| `مَرَرْتُ بِزَيْدٍ` | `بِزَيْدٍ` | `Majrur` | The preposition `بِـ`.                    |     |

#### 1.5.4 [[Umm al-Ulum Ref]]

This concept is the core of the entire `Nahw` section of the book, which begins on **page 45**.
*   **Page 47** provides a list of the types of `Marfu'` nouns.
*   The author uses the term `عامل` (agent) implicitly throughout. For example, he explains that a `Fā'il` is made `Marfu'` by the `Fi'l` before it.
*   The book is structured around the categories of `مرفوعات`, `منصوبات`, and `مجرورات`.

Excellent. We have now covered the essential components of basic `Sarf` (past, present, command, participles). Before we move on to the more complex derived verb forms, it is crucial to formally cover the most important structure in `Nahw` for nouns: the **Possessive Phrase**, or `Idāfah`. This concept is fundamental to understanding a vast number of Quranic verses.

---
---

### 1.6 The Possessive Phrase (`الإضافة` - al-Iḍāfah)

> [!NOTE] Core Concept
> The `الإضافة` (Iḍāfah) is a grammatical construction used to show possession or relationship between two or more nouns. It is the Arabic equivalent of using "'s" (the boy's book) or "of" (the book of the boy). It is formed by placing two nouns next to each other, where the first noun is "possessed" and the second is the "possessor".

#### 1.6.1 Quranic Hooks

The `Iḍāfah` is one of the most common structures in the Quran.

> [!QUOTE] Quranic Example 1 (Surah Al-Fatiha, 1:2)
> **الْحَمْدُ لِلَّهِ رَبِّ الْعَالَمِينَ**
> *[All] praise is [due] to Allah, **Lord of the worlds**.*
>
> **Analysis:** The phrase `رَبِّ الْعَالَمِينَ` (rabbi-l-`ālamīn`) is an `Iḍāfah`. `رَبِّ` (Lord) is the thing possessed, and `الْعَالَمِينَ` (the worlds) is the possessor.

> [!QUOTE] Quranic Example 2 (Surah An-Nas, 114:1)
> **قُلْ أَعُوذُ بِرَبِّ النَّاسِ**
> *Say, "I seek refuge in the **Lord of mankind**."*
>
> **Analysis:** `رَبِّ النَّاسِ` (rabbi-n-nās) is an `Iḍāfah`.

> [!QUOTE] Quranic Example 3 (Surah Al-Fil, 105:1)
> **أَلَمْ تَرَ كَيْفَ فَعَلَ رَبُّكَ بِأَصْحَابِ الْفِيلِ**
> *Have you not considered how your Lord dealt with the **companions of the elephant**?*
>
> **Analysis:** `أَصْحَابِ الْفِيلِ` (aṣḥābi-l-fīl) is an `Iḍāfah`.

#### 1.6.2 The Two Components of an `Iḍāfah`

An `Iḍāfah` consists of two parts, which have specific rules.

```mermaid
graph TD
    subgraph The Iḍāfah Construction الإضافة
        A[Muḍāf - مضاف<br>The Possessed] --> B[Muḍāf Ilayh - مضاف إليه<br>The Possessor];
    end

    style A fill:#e6f3ff,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px
    style B fill:#e6ffe6,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px
```

##### 1. The Possessed (`مضاف` - Muḍāf)
This is the first noun in the construction—the thing being owned or related to something else. It has two strict rules:

1.  **Rule 1: No `ال` (al-).** The `Muḍāf` can **never** have the definite article `ال`.
2.  **Rule 2: No `Tanween`.** The `Muḍāf` can **never** have `Tanween` (the `-un`, `-an`, `-in` endings). It takes only a single vowel.

*   **`I'rāb`:** The status (`Marfu'`, `Mansub'`, or `Majrur'`) of the `Muḍāf` depends entirely on its role in the sentence. It can be a subject, an object, or anything else.

##### 2. The Possessor (`مضاف إليه` - Muḍāf Ilayh)
This is the second noun in the construction—the owner. It has one strict rule:

1.  **Rule 1: Always `Majrūr`.** The `Muḍāf Ilayh` is **always** in the Genitive Case (`مجرور` - Majrūr). This is its defining characteristic.

*   **Definiteness:** The `Muḍāf Ilayh` can be definite or indefinite.

#### 1.6.3 Analyzing the `Iḍāfah`

Let's analyze the phrase "the door of the house" - `بَابُ الْبَيْتِ` (bābu-l-bayti).

| Component | Arabic Word | Rules Applied | `I'rāb` (Status) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **`Muḍāf`** | `بَابُ` (bābu) | 1. No `ال`. <br> 2. No `Tanween`. | `Marfu'` (in this case, as a subject). It could be `بَابَ` or `بَابِ` in other sentences. |
| **`Muḍāf Ilayh`** | `الْبَيْتِ` (al-bayti) | 1. Is `Majrūr`. | Always `Majrur`. |

**Definiteness of the `Iḍāfah`:**
The `Muḍāf` is like a chameleon; it takes its definiteness from the `Muḍāf Ilayh`.
*   If the `Muḍāf Ilayh` is definite (like `الْبَيْتِ`), the entire phrase is considered **definite**. `بَابُ الْبَيْتِ` means "**the** door of the house".
*   If the `Muḍāf Ilayh` is indefinite (like `بَيْتٍ`), the entire phrase is considered **indefinite**. `بَابُ بَيْتٍ` means "**a** door of **a** house".

#### 1.6.4 `Iḍāfah` Chains
You can chain multiple `Iḍāfah` constructions together.

*   Example: "the key of the door of the house" - `مِفْتَاحُ بَابِ الْبَيْتِ`
    *   `مِفْتَاحُ`: `Muḍāf`.
    *   `بَابِ`: `Muḍāf Ilayh` to `مِفْتَاحُ`, but also a `Muḍāf` to `الْبَيْتِ`. It is a middle link.
    *   `الْبَيْتِ`: `Muḍāf Ilayh`.

Notice the middle link `بَابِ` follows the rules of both: it has no `ال` or `Tanween` (as a `Muḍāf`) and it is `Majrur` (as a `Muḍāf Ilayh`).

#### 1.6.5 [[Umm al-Ulum Ref]]

The author discusses the `Iḍāfah` construction under the topic of `مجرورات` (the things that are `Majrur`).
*   **Page 48:** The author introduces the concept of the `مركب إضافي` (murakkab iḍāfī - the possessive compound). He defines the `مضاف` and `مضاف إليه` and gives examples like `رَسُولُ اللَّهِ` and `عِبَادُ الرَّحْمَٰنِ`.

#### 1.6.6 Quick Revision Scaffold

> [!SUMMARY] The Two Rules of `Iḍāfah`
> 1.  **The `Muḍāf` (Possessed, 1st Noun):**
>     *   **NO `ال`**
>     *   **NO `Tanween`**
>     *   Its `I'rāb` changes based on the sentence.
> 2.  **The `Muḍāf Ilayh` (Possessor, 2nd Noun):**
>     *   **ALWAYS `Majrūr`**

#### 1.6.7 Quranic Exercises

**Task:** Identify the `Muḍāf` and `Muḍāf Ilayh` in the following verses.

1.  > **سُبْحَانَ رَبِّكَ رَبِّ الْعِزَّةِ عَمَّا يَصِفُونَ** (Surah As-Saffat, 37:180)
    > *Exalted is your Lord, the Lord of might, above what they describe.*

2.  > **تَبَّتْ يَدَا أَبِي لَهَبٍ وَتَبَّ** (Surah Al-Masad, 111:1)
    > *May the hands of Abu Lahab be ruined, and ruined is he.*

3.  > **فَوَسَطْنَ بِهِ جَمْعًا** (Surah Al-Adiyat, 100:5)
    > *And striking thereby a gathering [of enemies].* (Note: This is a trick! `جَمْعًا` is an object, not a `Muḍāf Ilayh`. There is no `Iḍāfah` here.)

**Answers to Exercises:**

1.  **Verse 1 Analysis:**
    *   **Iḍāfah 1:** `رَبِّكَ` (your Lord)
        *   `Muḍāf`: `رَبِّ`
        *   `Muḍāf Ilayh`: `كَ` (the attached pronoun "your")
    *   **Iḍāfah 2:** `رَبِّ الْعِزَّةِ` (Lord of might)
        *   `Muḍāf`: `رَبِّ`
        *   `Muḍāf Ilayh`: `الْعِزَّةِ`

2.  **Verse 2 Analysis:**
    *   **Iḍāfah 1:** `يَدَا أَبِي` (the two hands of Abu...)
        *   `Muḍāf`: `يَدَا` (the dual form of `يَد`, with the `nūn` dropped because it's a `Muḍāf`).
        *   `Muḍāf Ilayh`: `أَبِي`
    *   **Iḍāfah 2:** `أَبِي لَهَبٍ` (Abu Lahab)
        *   `Muḍāf`: `أَبِي`
        *   `Muḍāf Ilayh`: `لَهَبٍ`

Excellent. We have now covered all the `Sarf` topics from the source text. Before we create the final `Nahw` chapters, it is essential to insert a foundational chapter that was missing from our initial plan but is crucial from a pedagogical standpoint: **`Mabnī` vs. `Mu'rab`**.

This chapter explains *why* some words change their endings (`I'rāb`) while others are fixed. Placing it here, before we dive into the advanced `Nahw` topics, will clarify many concepts and prevent future confusion.

---
---

### 1.8 Foundational Concepts: Declinable vs. Indeclinable Words (`المعرب والمبني`)

> [!NOTE] Core Concept
> All words in Arabic fall into one of two categories regarding their endings:
> 1.  **`المُعْرَب` (al-Mu'rab): Declinable.** These are words whose endings **change** to reflect their grammatical case (`I'rāb`). Most nouns and present tense verbs are in this category.
> 2.  **`المَبْنِي` (al-Mabnī): Indeclinable / Fixed.** These are words whose endings **do not change**, regardless of their grammatical role. They are "built" (`mabnī`) on a fixed ending.

#### 1.8.1 Quranic Hooks

Observe the difference between the word `مُحَمَّد` and the pronoun `هُوَ`.

> [!QUOTE] Quranic Example 1: A `Mu'rab` Word
> *   `Marfū'`: `مُحَمَّدٌ رَّسُولُ اللَّهِ` (Muhammad is the Messenger of Allah).
> *   `Manṣūb`: `إِنَّ مُحَمَّدًا رَّسُولُ اللَّهِ` (Indeed, Muhammad is the Messenger of Allah).
> *   `Majrūr`: `آمَنْتُ بِمُحَمَّدٍ` (I believed in Muhammad).
>
> **Analysis:** The word `مُحَمَّد` is **`Mu'rab`**. Its ending changes from `ـٌ` to `ـً` to `ـٍ` to show its case.

> [!QUOTE] Quranic Example 2: A `Mabnī` Word
> *   `Marfū'`: `قُلْ هُوَ اللَّهُ أَحَدٌ` (**He** is Allah, the One). (`huwa` is the `Mubtada'`).
> *   `Manṣūb`: `إِنَّهُ هُوَ السَّمِيعُ الْعَلِيمُ` (Indeed, **He** - He is the All-Hearing, the All-Knowing). (`huwa` is for emphasis).
> *   `Majrūr`: `آمَنَّا بِهِ` (We believed in **Him**). (The pronoun becomes `ـهِ`, but the base `huwa` is fixed).
>
> **Analysis:** The detached pronoun `هُوَ` is **`Mabnī`**. It doesn't change its form. Even when it becomes an attached pronoun, it has a fixed form for each case (`ـهُ`, `ـهِ`).

#### 1.8.2 The Categories of `Mabnī` Words

The vast majority of words are `Mu'rab`. It is easier to memorize the categories of words that are `Mabnī`.

```mermaid
graph TD
    subgraph Mabnī (Fixed) Words
        A[1. All Particles (حروف)]
        B[2. All Past Tense & Command Verbs]
        C[3. Pronouns (الضمائر)]
        D[4. Demonstrative Pronouns (أسماء الإشارة)]
        E[5. Relative Pronouns (الأسماء الموصولة)]
        F[6. Some Adverbs & Nouns]
    end
```

##### 1. All Particles (`الحروف`)
Every `Harf` is `Mabnī`. Their endings never change.
*   `مِنْ` (min), `فِي` (fī), `إِنَّ` (inna), `لَمْ` (lam), `وَ` (wa).

##### 2. All Past Tense and Command Verbs
*   The `Fi'l Māḍī` is `Mabnī`. For example, `كَتَبَ` is "built upon a `fathah`". Its ending only changes to accommodate a suffix (e.g., `كَتَبُوا`), not due to an external agent.
*   The `Fi'l al-Amr` is `Mabnī`. For example, `اُكْتُبْ` is "built upon a `sukūn`".

##### 3. All Pronouns (`الضمائر`)
*   Both detached (`هُوَ`, `أَنَا`) and attached (`ـهُ`, `ـكَ`) pronouns are `Mabnī`.

##### 4. Demonstrative Pronouns (`أسماء الإشارة`)
*   These are words like "this" and "that".
*   **Examples:** `هَٰذَا` (hādhā - this, masc.), `هَٰذِهِ` (hādhihi - this, fem.), `ذَٰلِكَ` (dhālika - that, masc.), `أُولَٰئِكَ` (ulā'ika - those).
*   **Exception:** The dual forms (`هَذَانِ`, `هَاتَانِ`) are `Mu'rab` and change their endings.

##### 5. Relative Pronouns (`الأسماء الموصولة`)
*   These are words like "the one who" or "that which".
*   **Examples:** `الَّذِي` (alladhī - who, masc. sing.), `الَّتِي` (allatī - who, fem. sing.), `الَّذِينَ` (alladhīna - who, masc. pl.).
*   **Exception:** The dual forms (`اللَّذَانِ`, `اللَّتَانِ`) are `Mu'rab`.

#### 1.8.3 The Concept of "Local `I'rāb`" (`في محل`)

If a `Mabnī` word occupies a position that *should* have a certain case, we say it is **"in the position of" (`في محل` - fī maḥall)** that case.

*   **Example:** `جَاءَ هَٰذَا الرَّجُلُ` (This man came).
    *   `جَاءَ` is the verb. We need a `Fā'il` (doer), which must be `Marfu'`.
    *   `هَٰذَا` is the doer. But `هَٰذَا` is `Mabnī` and cannot take a `dammah`.
    *   **Analysis:** We say `هَٰذَا` is `مبني على السكون` (fixed on a `sukūn`) `فِي مَحَلِّ رَفْعٍ` (**in the position of being `Marfu'`**) because it is the `Fā'il`.

This concept is crucial for parsing sentences containing `Mabnī` words.

#### 1.8.4 [[Umm al-Ulum Ref]]

The source book does not have a single, dedicated chapter for `Mabnī` vs. `Mu'rab`. Instead, this foundational concept is woven into the discussion of each word type. For example, when discussing pronouns, it is understood that they are fixed. This is a key area where a modern pedagogical approach can add significant clarity by bringing this concept to the forefront and explaining it explicitly before learners encounter the exceptions.

#### 1.8.5 Quick Revision Scaffold

> [!SUMMARY] Declinable vs. Indeclinable
> 1.  **`Mu'rab` (Declinable):** Ending changes.
>     *   Includes most nouns and present tense verbs.
>     *   Example: `كِتَابٌ`, `كِتَابًا`, `كِتَابٍ`.
> 2.  **`Mabnī` (Indeclinable):** Ending is fixed.
>     *   Includes all particles, past/command verbs, pronouns, and most demonstrative/relative pronouns.
>     *   Example: `هَٰذَا` is always `هَٰذَا`.
> 3.  **Local `I'rāb` (`في محل`):** A `Mabnī` word can be "in the position of" being `Marfu'`, `Manṣūb'`, or `Majrūr'`.

#### 1.8.6 Quranic Exercises

**Task:** For each verse, identify the `Mabnī` words (excluding simple particles like `و` or `ف`).

1.  > **ذَٰلِكَ الْكِتَابُ لَا رَيْبَ فِيهِ** (Surah Al-Baqarah, 2:2)
    > *That is the Book, wherein is no doubt.*

2.  > **الَّذِينَ يُؤْمِنُونَ بِالْغَيْبِ وَيُقِيمُونَ الصَّلَاةَ** (Surah Al-Baqarah, 2:3)
    > *Who believe in the unseen, establish prayer...*

3.  > **أُولَٰئِكَ عَلَىٰ هُدًى مِّن رَّبِّهِمْ وَأُولَٰئِكَ هُمُ الْمُفْلِحُونَ** (Surah Al-Baqarah, 2:5)
    > *Those are upon guidance from their Lord, and it is those who are the successful.*

**Answers to Exercises:**

1.  **Verse 1 Analysis:**
    *   `ذَٰلِكَ`: `Mabnī` (Demonstrative Pronoun).
    *   `فِيهِ`: The attached pronoun `ـهِ` is `Mabnī`.

2.  **Verse 2 Analysis:**
    *   `الَّذِينَ`: `Mabnī` (Relative Pronoun).
    *   `يُؤْمِنُونَ`: The verb itself is `Mu'rab`, but the `ـوا` suffix (which is the `Fā'il`) is a `Mabnī` pronoun.
    *   `يُقِيمُونَ`: Same as above.

3.  **Verse 3 Analysis:**
    *   `أُولَٰئِكَ`: `Mabnī` (Demonstrative Pronoun), used twice.
    *   `عَلَىٰ`: `Mabnī` (Particle).
    *   `ـهِمْ` (in `رَّبِّهِمْ`): `Mabnī` (Attached Pronoun).
    *   `هُمُ`: `Mabnī` (Detached Pronoun).

Excellent. We have now laid the complete foundation for `Nahw` (Syntax). We will now pivot to the first major topic in `Sarf` (Morphology): the past tense verb. This is essential because the verb is the engine of the verbal sentence, and understanding its conjugations is the first step to mastering the language's structure.

This chapter will be our first deep dive into the conjugation tables that form the core of the first half of "Umm al-Ulum wa Abuha".

---

## 2.0 The Science of Word-Formation (`علم الصرف` - `Ilm al-Sarf`)

### 2.1 The Past Tense Verb (`الفعل الماضي` - al-Fi'l al-Māḍī)

> [!NOTE] Core Concept
> The `الفعل الماضي` (Fi'l Māḍī) is the verb form used to describe an action that was completed in the past. It is the simplest verb form and serves as the base (`أصل` - aṣl) from which many other verb forms and nouns are derived. The default, "dictionary entry" form is the 3rd person masculine singular, such as `كَتَبَ` (kataba - he wrote).

#### 2.1.1 Quranic Hooks

Observe how the verb "to create" (`خَلَقَ`) changes its ending to reflect who performed the action.

> [!QUOTE] Quranic Example 1 (Surah Al-Alaq, 96:1-2)
> **اقْرَأْ بِاسْمِ رَبِّكَ الَّذِي خَلَقَ (1) خَلَقَ الْإِنسَانَ مِنْ عَلَقٍ (2)**
> *Read in the name of your Lord who **created** (1). **He created** man from a clinging substance (2).*
>
> **Analysis:** `خَلَقَ` (khalaqa) is the base form, meaning "**He** created". The doer (`Fā'il`) is a hidden pronoun, `هُوَ` (huwa - he).

> [!QUOTE] Quranic Example 2 (Surah Az-Zumar, 39:6)
> **خَلَقَكُم مِّن نَّفْسٍ وَاحِدَةٍ**
> *He **created you** from a single soul.*
>
> **Analysis:** `خَلَقَكُمْ` (khalaqa**kum**) is the same base verb `خَلَقَ` with an attached pronoun `كُمْ` (kum - you plural). The meaning is "**He created you**".

> [!QUOTE] Quranic Example 3 (Surah Al-Mu'minun, 23:12)
> **وَلَقَدْ خَلَقْنَا الْإِنسَانَ مِن سُلَالَةٍ مِّن طِينٍ**
> *And certainly, **We created** man from an extract of clay.*
>
> **Analysis:** `خَلَقْنَا` (khalaq**nā**) is a different form. The `ـنَا` suffix changes the doer from "He" to "**We**". This change is called conjugation.

#### 2.1.2 The Conjugation Paradigm (`تصريف` - Taṣrīf)

Conjugation is the process of changing the verb form to reflect the doer (`Fā'il`). The `Fi'l Māḍī` is conjugated by adding suffixes to the end of the root verb.

The most important paradigm to memorize is for the standard three-letter verb. We will use `فَعَلَ` (fa'ala - he did) as the pattern and `كَتَبَ` (kataba - he wrote) as our primary example.

```mermaid

        C[1st Person<br>المتكلم<br>I/We]
    end
```

##### The `Fi'l Māḍī` Conjugation Table

This table is the key to `Sarf`. It must be memorized.

| Person | Gender | Number | Pronoun | Suffix | Example: `كَتَبَ` (to write) | Translation |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **3rd** | **Masc.** | Singular | `هُوَ` | `ـَ` (none) | `كَتَبَ` | He wrote |
| | | Dual | `هُمَا` | `ـَا` | `كَتَبَا` | They (2) wrote |
| | | Plural | `هُمْ` | `ـُوا` | `كَتَبُوا` | They (>2) wrote |
| | **Fem.** | Singular | `هِيَ` | `ـَتْ` | `كَتَبَتْ` | She wrote |
| | | Dual | `هُمَا` | `ـَتَا` | `كَتَبَتَا` | They (2) wrote |
| | | Plural | `هُنَّ` | `ـْنَ` | `كَتَبْنَ` | They (>2) wrote |
| **2nd** | **Masc.** | Singular | `أَنْتَ` | `ـْتَ` | `كَتَبْتَ` | You wrote |
| | | Dual | `أَنْتُمَا` | `ـْتُمَا` | `كَتَبْتُمَا` | You (2) wrote |
| | | Plural | `أَنْتُمْ` | `ـْتُمْ` | `كَتَبْتُمْ` | You (>2) wrote |
| | **Fem.** | Singular | `أَنْتِ` | `ـْتِ` | `كَتَبْتِ` | You wrote |
| | | Dual | `أَنْتُمَا` | `ـْتُمَا` | `كَتَبْتُمَا` | You (2) wrote |
| | | Plural | `أَنْتُنَّ` | `ـْتُنَّ` | `كَتَبْتُنَّ` | You (>2) wrote |
| **1st** | **M/F** | Singular | `أَنَا` | `ـْتُ` | `كَتَبْتُ` | I wrote |
| | | Plural | `نَحْنُ` | `ـْنَا` | `كَتَبْنَا` | We wrote |

> [!IMPORTANT] Notice the `sukūn` (ـْ) on the last letter of the root verb from the `هُنَّ` form (`katabna`) onwards. This is a critical phonological rule.

#### 2.1.3 Attached Object Pronouns (`الضمائر المتصلة` - al-Ḍamā'ir al-Muttaṣilah)

The `Fi'l Māḍī` can also have an object pronoun attached directly to it.

*   **Example:** `خَلَقَ` (He created) + `كَ` (you) = `خَلَقَكَ` (He created you).
*   **Quranic Example:** `أَلَمْ نَخْلُقكُّم مِّن مَّاءٍ مَّهِينٍ` (Did We not create you from a worthless fluid?) - Surah Al-Mursalat, 77:20. Here, `نَخْلُقْ` (We create) + `كُمْ` (you plural) = `نَخْلُقْكُمْ` (We create you).

#### 2.1.4 [[Umm al-Ulum Ref]]

The first half of the book is dedicated to `Sarf`. The author introduces the `Fi'l Māḍī` paradigm using the verb `ضَرَبَ` (ḍaraba - he hit).
*   **Page 12:** Presents the full conjugation table for the active past tense (`صرف كبير فعل ماضى معلوم`).
*   **Page 13:** Presents the table for the passive past tense (`فعل ماضى مجهول`), which we will cover later.

The author's approach is based on pure memorization of these paradigms, which is a time-tested method.

#### 2.1.6 Quranic Exercises

**Task:** Identify the past tense verb in each verse, translate it, and identify the doer (e.g., "He", "We", "They").

1.  > **آمَنَّا بِاللَّهِ وَمَا أُنزِلَ إِلَيْنَا** (Surah Al-Baqarah, 2:136)
    > *We have believed in Allah and what has been revealed to us.*

2.  > **فَسَجَدُوا إِلَّا إِبْلِيسَ** (Surah Al-Baqarah, 2:34)
    > *So they prostrated, except for Iblees.*

3.  > **لَقَدْ كَفَرَ الَّذِينَ قَالُوا إِنَّ اللَّهَ هُوَ الْمَسِيحُ ابْنُ مَرْيَمَ** (Surah Al-Ma'idah, 5:72)
    > *They have certainly disbelieved who said, "Indeed, Allah is the Messiah, the son of Mary."*

**Answers to Exercises:**

1.  **Verse 1 Analysis:**
    *   **Verb:** `آمَنَّا` (āmannā)
    *   **Translation:** We believed
    *   **Doer:** `نَحْنُ` (We), indicated by the `ـنَا` suffix.

2.  **Verse 2 Analysis:**
    *   **Verb:** `سَجَدُوا` (sajadū)
    *   **Translation:** They prostrated
    *   **Doer:** `هُمْ` (They, masculine plural), indicated by the `ـُوا` suffix.

3.  **Verse 3 Analysis:**
    *   **Verb 1:** `كَفَرَ` (kafara) - He disbelieved. The doer is specified later as `الَّذِينَ`.
    *   **Verb 2:** `قَالُوا` (qālū) - They said. The doer is `هُمْ` (They, masculine plural), referring back to `الَّذِينَ`.

Perfect. Now that we have covered the past tense, the logical next step in `Sarf` is the present tense verb. This will introduce new concepts like prefixes and more complex `I'rāb` states for verbs.

### 2.2 The Present & Future Tense Verb (`الفعل المضارع` - al-Fi'l al-Muḍāriʿ)

> [!NOTE] Core Concept
> The `الفعل المضارع` (Fi'l Muḍāriʿ) is the verb form used to describe an action that is currently happening (present tense) or will happen (future tense). Unlike the past tense which only uses suffixes, the `Muḍāriʿ` is formed using a combination of **prefixes and suffixes**.

#### 2.2.1 Quranic Hooks

Observe the verb `يَعْلَمُ` (ya'lamu - he knows) and how it appears in different contexts.

> [!QUOTE] Quranic Example 1 (Surah Al-Baqarah, 2:235)
> **وَاعْلَمُوا أَنَّ اللَّهَ يَعْلَمُ مَا فِي أَنفُسِكُمْ**
> *And know that Allah **knows** what is within yourselves.*
>
> **Analysis:** `يَعْلَمُ` (ya'lamu) is the default present tense form, meaning "**He knows**". It is in the `Marfu'` state, indicated by the `dammah` at the end.

> [!QUOTE] Quranic Example 2 (Surah Al-Baqarah, 2:282)
> **وَاتَّقُوا اللَّهَ وَيُعَلِّمُكُمُ اللَّهُ**
> *And fear Allah, and Allah **teaches you**.*
>
> **Analysis:** `يُعَلِّمُ` (yu'allimu) is a different form of the verb "to know/teach". The `ـُكُم` is an attached object pronoun. The core verb `يُعَلِّمُ` means "**He teaches**".

> [!QUOTE] Quranic Example 3 (Surah Al-Hujurat, 49:1)
> **لَا تُقَدِّمُوا بَيْنَ يَدَيِ اللَّهِ وَرَسُولِهِ**
> *...do not put [yourselves] before Allah and His Messenger.*
>
> **Analysis:** `تُقَدِّمُوا` (tuqaddimū) is the `Muḍāriʿ` form for "**you all do**". The `لَا` before it is a particle of prohibition.

#### 2.2.2 The Formation of the `Muḍāriʿ`

The `Muḍāriʿ` is formed by taking the three-letter root (e.g., `ك ت ب`) and applying a specific prefix and suffix based on the doer.

1.  **The Prefixes (`حروف المضارعة`):** There are four prefixes, collectively remembered by the acronym `أَنَيْتُ` (anītu - I came) or `أَتَيْنَ` (atayna - we came).
    * A `أ` (a-) for the 1st person singular ("I").
    * B `ن` (na-) for the 1st person plural ("We").
    * C `ي` (ya-) for the 3rd person masculine ("He/They").
    * D `ت` (ta-) for the 2nd person ("You") and 3rd person feminine ("She/They").

2.  **The Suffixes:** These are added for dual and plural forms.

##### The `Fi'l Muḍāriʿ` Conjugation Table (Default `Marfu'` State)

This table shows the verb in its default nominative state.

| Person | Gender | Number | Prefix | Suffix | Example: `يَكْتُبُ` (to write) | Translation |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **3rd** | **Masc.** | Singular | `يَـ` | `ـُ` | `يَكْتُبُ` | He writes |
| | | Dual | `يَـ` | `ـَانِ` | `يَكْتُبَانِ` | They (2) write |
| | | Plural | `يَـ` | `ـُونَ` | `يَكْتُبُونَ` | They (>2) write |
| | **Fem.** | Singular | `تَـ` | `ـُ` | `تَكْتُبُ` | She writes |
| | | Dual | `تَـ` | `ـَانِ` | `تَكْتُبَانِ` | They (2) write |
| | | Plural | `يَـ` | `ـْنَ` | `يَكْتُبْنَ` | They (>2) write |
| **2nd** | **Masc.** | Singular | `تَـ` | `ـُ` | `تَكْتُبُ` | You write |
| | | Dual | `تَـ` | `ـَانِ` | `تَكْتُبَانِ` | You (2) write |
| | | Plural | `تَـ` | `ـُونَ` | `تَكْتُبُونَ` | You (>2) write |
| | **Fem.** | Singular | `تَـ` | `ـِينَ` | `تَكْتُبِينَ` | You write |
| | | Dual | `تَـ` | `ـَانِ` | `تَكْتُبَانِ` | You (2) write |
| | | Plural | `تَـ` | `ـْنَ` | `تَكْتُبْنَ` | You (>2) write |
| **1st** | **M/F** | Singular | `أَ` | `ـُ` | `أَكْتُبُ` | I write |
| | | Plural | `نَـ` | `ـُ` | `نَكْتُبُ` | We write |

> [!TIP] Note the overlaps: `تَكْتُبُ` can mean "she writes" or "you (m.) write". Context is key. `تَكْتُبَانِ` has three possible meanings.

#### 2.2.3 The `I'rāb` of the `Muḍāriʿ`

Unlike the past tense verb, which is fixed (`mabnī`), the `Fi'l Muḍāriʿ` has `I'rāb` and can change its state.

1.  **Nominative (`مرفوع` - Marfū'):** The default state. The verb ends in a `dammah` or retains its `ـن` (`nūn`) ending. Example: `يَكْتُبُونَ`.
2.  **Accusative (`منصوب` - Manṣūb):** Occurs after certain particles like `أَنْ` (an - to) or `لَنْ` (lan - will not). The `dammah` changes to a `fathah`, and the `nūn` is dropped from the end of most plural/dual forms.
    *   `يَكْتُبُ` → `لَنْ يَكْتُبَ` (he will not write)
    *   `يَكْتُبُونَ` → `لَنْ يَكْتُبُوا` (they will not write)
3.  **Jussive (`مجزوم` - Majzūm):** Occurs after particles like `لَمْ` (lam - did not) or `لَا` (lā - do not!). The `dammah` changes to a `sukūn`, and the `nūn` is also dropped.
    *   `يَكْتُبُ` → `لَمْ يَكْتُبْ` (he did not write)
    *   `يَكْتُبُونَ` → `لَمْ يَكْتُبُوا` (they did not write)

> [!IMPORTANT] The two feminine plural forms (`يَكْتُبْنَ` and `تَكْتُبْنَ`) are "fixed" (`mabnī`). Their endings never change, regardless of the particle before them.

#### 2.2.4 The Future Tense
To specify the future tense explicitly, you add a prefix to the `Marfu'` `Muḍāriʿ` form.
*   **`سَـ` (sa-) for the near future:** `سَيَكْتُبُ` (He will write soon).
*   **`سَوْفَ` (sawfa) for the distant future:** `سَوْفَ يَكْتُبُ` (He will write eventually).

#### 2.2.5 [[Umm al-Ulum Ref]]

The author introduces the `Fi'l Muḍāriʿ` immediately after the past tense.
*   **Page 14:** Presents the full conjugation table for the active present/future tense (`صرف كبير فعل مضارع معلوم`).
*   **Page 15:** Presents the table for the passive (`فعل مضارع مجهول`).
*   **Pages 16-17:** Show the tables for the verb after particles like `لَمْ` (Jussive) and `لَنْ` (Accusative), demonstrating the `I'rāb` changes.

> 3.  **Accusative State (`Mansub`):** After `لَنْ`, `أَنْ`, etc. `dammah` → `fathah`, drop `nūn`. `لَنْ يَذْهَبَ`, `لَنْ يَذْهَبُوا`.
> 4.  **Jussive State (`Majzūm`):** After `لَمْ`, `لَا` (prohibitive). `dammah` → `sukūn`, drop `nūn`. `لَمْ يَذْهَبْ`, `لَمْ يَذْهَبُوا`.
> 5.  **Future:** Add `سَـ` or `سَوْفَ` to the `Marfu'` form.

#### 2.2.7 Quranic Exercises

**Task:** Identify the `Fi'l Muḍāriʿ` in each verse. State its person/number/gender, its `I'rāb` state, and its translation.

1.  > **يُرِيدُ اللَّهُ بِكُمُ الْيُسْرَ وَلَا يُرِيدُ بِكُمُ الْعُسْرَ** (Surah Al-Baqarah, 2:185)
    > *Allah intends for you ease and does not intend for you hardship.*

2.  > **فَإِن لَّمْ تَفْعَلُوا وَلَن تَفْعَلُوا فَاتَّقُوا النَّارَ** (Surah Al-Baqarah, 2:24)
    > *And if you do not do it - and you will never do it - then fear the Fire.*

3.  > **قَالُوا نَعْبُدُ إِلَٰهَكَ وَإِلَٰهَ آبَائِكَ** (Surah Al-Baqarah, 2:133)
    > *They said, "We will worship your god and the god of your fathers."*

**Answers to Exercises:**

1.  **Verse 1 Analysis:**
    *   **Verb 1:** `يُرِيدُ` (yurīdu) - 3rd, Masc, Sing. `Marfu'`. "He intends".
    *   **Verb 2:** `يُرِيدُ` (yurīdu) - 3rd, Masc, Sing. `Marfu'`. "He does not intend". (The `لَا` here is for negation, not prohibition, so it doesn't change the `I'rāb`).

2.  **Verse 2 Analysis:**
    *   **Verb 1:** `تَفْعَلُوا` (taf'alū) - 2nd, Masc, Plural. `Majzūm` (because of `لَمْ`). "you all do".
    *   **Verb 2:** `تَفْعَلُوا` (taf'alū) - 2nd, Masc, Plural. `Mansub` (because of `لَنْ`). "you all will do".

3.  **Verse 3 Analysis:**
    *   **Verb:** `نَعْبُدُ` (na'budu) - 1st, Plural. `Marfu'`. "We worship".

Excellent. We have now covered the two main tenses. The next logical step in `Sarf` is the **Imperative** or **Command** form of the verb. This chapter will explain how to construct a command, which is derived directly from the `Fi'l Muḍāriʿ`.

---
---

### 2.3 The Imperative Verb (`فعل الأمر` - Fi'l al-Amr)

> [!NOTE] Core Concept
> The `فعل الأمر` (Fi'l al-Amr) is the verb form used to issue a command or make a request. It is only conjugated for the 2nd person (the person being addressed: "you"). It is derived from the **Jussive (`مجزوم`)** form of the `Fi'l Muḍāriʿ`.

#### 2.3.1 Quranic Hooks

The `Fi'l al-Amr` is abundant in the Quran, as it is the primary form through which Allah issues commands to humanity.

> [!QUOTE] Quranic Example 1 (Surah Al-Alaq, 96:1)
> **اقْرَأْ بِاسْمِ رَبِّكَ الَّذِي خَلَقَ**
> ***Read*** *in the name of your Lord who created.*
>
> **Analysis:** `اقْرَأْ` (iqra') is the command form for "you (masc. singular)".

> [!QUOTE] Quranic Example 2 (Surah Al-Baqarah, 2:43)
> **وَأَقِيمُوا الصَّلَاةَ وَآتُوا الزَّكَاةَ وَارْكَعُوا مَعَ الرَّاكِعِينَ**
> *And **establish** prayer and **give** zakah and **bow** with those who bow.*
>
> **Analysis:** `أَقِيمُوا` (aqīmū), `آتُوا` (ātū), and `ارْكَعُوا` (irka'ū) are all command forms for "you (masc. plural)".

> [!QUOTE] Quranic Example 3 (Surah Maryam, 19:26)
> **فَكُلِي وَاشْرَبِي وَقَرِّي عَيْنًا**
> *So **eat** and **drink** and **be cool** of eye.*
>
> **Analysis:** `كُلِي` (kulī), `اشْرَبِي` (ishrabī), and `قَرِّي` (qarrī) are all command forms for "you (fem. singular)", addressed to Maryam.

#### 2.3.2 The Four-Step Derivation of the `Amr`

The command form is not a new, independent form; it is systematically derived from the 2nd person `Muḍāriʿ`. Let's derive the command "write!" (`اُكْتُبْ`) from the verb `تَكْتُبُ` (you write).

1.  **Step 1: Start with the `Muḍāriʿ`**
    *   Take the 2nd person masculine singular form: `تَكْتُبُ` (taktubu).

2.  **Step 2: Make it Jussive (`مجزوم`)**
    *   Put it into the `Majzūm` state by adding `لَمْ` (or imagining it). The `dammah` becomes a `sukūn`.
    *   `تَكْتُبُ` → `لَمْ تَكْتُبْ` (lam taktub).

3.  **Step 3: Drop the `Muḍāriʿ` Prefix**
    *   Remove the prefix `تَـ`.
    *   `تَكْتُبْ` → `كْتُبْ` (ktub).

4.  **Step 4: Add a Helping `Hamzah` (if needed)**
    *   The result `كْتُبْ` starts with a letter that has a `sukūn` (`كْ`), which is impossible to pronounce at the beginning of a word in Arabic.
    *   To solve this, we add a temporary `hamzah` (`همزة الوصل` - hamzat al-waṣl) at the beginning.
    *   `كْتُبْ` → `اُكْتُبْ` (uktub).

    **The Vowel of the Helping `Hamzah`:**
    *   The vowel on this new `hamzah` depends on the vowel of the middle root letter (the `ع` in `فَعَلَ`).
    *   **Rule:** If the middle root letter in the `Muḍāriʿ` form has a `dammah` (u), the helping `hamzah` takes a `dammah`. Example: `تَكْتُبُ` (takt**u**bu) → `اُكْتُبْ` (**u**ktub).
    *   **Rule:** If the middle root letter has a `fathah` (a) or a `kasrah` (i), the helping `hamzah` takes a `kasrah`. Example: `تَجْلِسُ` (tajl**i**su) → `اِجْلِسْ` (**i**jlis - sit!).

#### 2.3.3 The `Fi'l al-Amr` Conjugation Table

The table is built by applying the same four steps to all 2nd person forms.

| Person | Gender | Number | `Muḍāriʿ` (Majzūm) | `Amr` (Command) | Translation |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **2nd** | **Masc.** | Singular | `تَكْتُبْ` | `اُكْتُبْ` | Write! |
| | | Dual | `تَكْتُبَا` | `اُكْتُبَا` | Write! (you 2) |
| | | Plural | `تَكْتُبُوا` | `اُكْتُبُوا` | Write! (you all) |
| | **Fem.** | Singular | `تَكْتُبِي` | `اُكْتُبِي` | Write! |
| | | Dual | `تَكْتُبَا` | `اُكْتُبَا` | Write! (you 2) |
| | | Plural | `تَكْتُبْنَ` | `اُكْتُبْنَ` | Write! (you all) |

> [!IMPORTANT]
> *   The `Amr` is built on the `Majzūm` form. This means the final `nūn` from the `Muḍāriʿ` is dropped in the dual and plural forms (except for the fixed feminine plural `تَكْتُبْنَ`).
> *   The final state of the `Amr` verb is considered `Majzūm`.

#### 2.3.4 The Prohibitive (`النهي` - al-Nahy)
The prohibitive is used to command someone *not* to do something. It is simpler to form.

1.  **Formation:** Take the 2nd person `Muḍāriʿ` verb.
2.  **Add `لَا` (lā):** Place the particle `لَا` (meaning "do not") before it.
3.  **Make it Jussive (`Majzūm`):** The verb takes the `Majzūm` form.

*   **Example:** `تَكْتُبُ` (you write) → `لَا تَكْتُبْ` (lā taktub - Do not write!).
*   **Quranic Example:** `وَلَا تَقُولُوا لِمَن يُقْتَلُ فِي سَبِيلِ اللَّهِ أَمْوَاتٌ` (And do not say about those who are killed in the way of Allah, "They are dead.") - Surah Al-Baqarah, 2:154.

#### 2.3.5 [[Umm al-Ulum Ref]]

The author covers the `Amr` and `Nahy` in detail.
*   **Page 18:** Presents the table for the `Amr` (`صرف كبير فعل امر حاضر معلوم`).
*   **Page 20:** Presents the table for the `Nahy` (`صرف كبير فعل نهى حاضر معلوم`).
The book presents these as separate paradigms to be memorized, while our note emphasizes the systematic derivation from the `Muḍāriʿ` to aid comprehension.

**Task:** Identify the `Fi'l al-Amr` or `Nahy` in each verse and state who is being commanded (e.g., you masc. singular, you fem. plural, etc.).

1.  > **اذْهَبْ إِلَىٰ فِرْعَوْنَ إِنَّهُ طَغَىٰ** (Surah Taha, 20:24)
    > *Go to Pharaoh. Indeed, he has transgressed.*

2.  > **يَا أَيُّهَا الَّذِينَ آمَنُوا لَا تَرْفَعُوا أَصْوَاتَكُمْ فَوْقَ صَوْتِ النَّبِيِّ** (Surah Al-Hujurat, 49:2)
    > *O you who have believed, do not raise your voices above the voice of the Prophet.*

3.  > **وَقُل لِّلْمُؤْمِنَاتِ يَغْضُضْنَ مِنْ أَبْصَارِهِنَّ** (Surah An-Nur, 24:31)
    > *And tell the believing women to lower their gaze.* (Note: `يَغْضُضْنَ` is a 3rd person `Muḍāriʿ` in the jussive state, functioning as an indirect command. The direct command would be `اُغْضُضْنَ`).

**Answers to Exercises:**

1.  **Verse 1 Analysis:**
    *   **Verb:** `اذْهَبْ` (idh'hab)
    *   **Command Type:** `Amr` (Command)

Excellent. We have now covered the core verb forms for past, present, and command. The next essential pieces of `Sarf` are the **participles**. These are special nouns derived from verbs that are incredibly common in the Quran and function like adjectives or nouns describing the "doer" or "receiver" of an action.

---
---

### 2.4 The Participles (`اسم الفاعل` and `اسم المفعول`)

> [!NOTE] Core Concept
> Participles are nouns (`Ism`) that are derived directly from a verb to describe the one performing an action or the one upon whom an action is performed.
> *   The **Active Participle (`اسم الفاعل` - Ism al-Fā'il)** describes the "doer" of the verb.
> *   The **Passive Participle (`اسم المفعول` - Ism al-Maf'ūl)** describes the "receiver" or "object" of the verb's action.

#### 2.4.1 Quranic Hooks

Notice how the root `ك ف ر` (to disbelieve) is used to create different types of nouns.

> [!QUOTE] Quranic Example 1: The Active Participle
> **قُلْ يَا أَيُّهَا الْكَافِرُونَ** (Surah Al-Kafirun, 109:1)
> *Say, "O **disbelievers**!"*
>
> **Analysis:** `الْكَافِرُونَ` (al-kāfirūn) is the plural of `كَافِر` (kāfir). A `kāfir` is "one who disbelieves". This is the `Ism al-Fā'il`.

> [!QUOTE] Quranic Example 2: The Passive Participle
> **ذَٰلِكَ الْكِتَابُ لَا رَيْبَ فِيهِ هُدًى لِّلْمُتَّقِينَ** (Surah Al-Baqarah, 2:2)
> *That is the Book, wherein is no doubt, a guidance for the **God-conscious**.*
>
> **Analysis:** `الْمُتَّقِينَ` (al-muttaqīn) is the plural of `مُتَّقٍ` (muttaqin), which is the `Ism al-Fā'il` from a derived verb form meaning "one who is conscious/guards himself".

> [!QUOTE] Quranic Example 3: The Passive Participle
> **فَجَعَلَهُمْ كَعَصْفٍ مَّأْكُولٍ** (Surah Al-Fil, 105:5)
> *And He made them like straw, **eaten up**.*
>
> **Analysis:** `مَّأْكُولٍ` (ma'kūlin) means "that which is eaten". It describes the object of the action. This is the `Ism al-Maf'ūl`.

#### 2.4.2 Detailed Explanation

Participles are a bridge between verbs (`Fi'l`) and nouns (`Ism`). They are technically nouns and have all four properties of a noun (Status, Number, Gender, Type), but they carry the meaning of a verb.

    A[Verb Root<br>e.g., ك ت ب<br>to write] --> B[Ism al-Fā'il - اسم الفاعل<br>Active Participle];
    A --> C[Ism al-Maf'ūl - اسم المفعول<br>Passive Participle];

    C --> C1[Pattern: مَفْعُول<br>مَكْتُوب<br><i>Written / That which is written</i>];
```

##### 1. The Active Participle (`اسم الفاعل` - Ism al-Fā'il)
This noun identifies the doer of the action. For the basic three-letter verb (`Form I`), it is formed on the pattern `فَاعِل` (fā'il).

1.  **Formation:**
    *   Take the root letters, e.g., `ع ل م` (`alima` - he knew).
    *   Place them into the `فَاعِل` pattern.
    *   Result: `عَالِم` (`ālim` - a knower, a scholar).

2.  **Function and Examples:**
    *   It can act as a simple noun: `جَاءَ عَالِمٌ` (A scholar came).
    *   It can act as an adjective: `جَاءَ رَجُلٌ عَالِمٌ` (A knowledgeable man came).
    *   It can even function like a verb and take an object: `زَيْدٌ عَالِمٌ الْغَيْبَ` (Zayd is a knower of the unseen).

| Verb Root | Verb (He did) | `Ism al-Fā'il` (Doer) | Translation |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `ق ت ل` | `قَتَلَ` | `قَاتِل` | Killer / One who kills |
| `ص د ق` | `صَدَقَ` | `صَادِق` | Truthful one / One who is truthful |
| `خ ل ق` | `خَلَقَ` | `خَالِق` | Creator / One who creates |

##### 2. The Passive Participle (`اسم المفعول` - Ism al-Maf'ūl)
This noun identifies the object or receiver of the action. For the basic three-letter verb (`Form I`), it is formed on the pattern `مَفْعُول` (maf'ūl).

1.  **Formation:**
    *   Take the root letters, e.g., `ع ل م` (`alima` - he knew).
    *   Place them into the `مَفْعُول` pattern.
    *   Result: `مَعْلُوم` (ma'lūm - that which is known).

2.  **Function and Examples:**
    *   It almost always functions as an adjective or a predicate, describing something that has had an action done to it.
    *   `هَٰذَا أَمْرٌ مَّعْلُومٌ` (This is a known matter).
    *   `كَانَ وَعْدُهُ مَأْتِيًّا` (His promise is one that is fulfilled/come to).

| Verb Root | Verb (He did) | `Ism al-Maf'ūl` (Receiver) | Translation |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `ق ت ل` | `قَتَلَ` | `مَقْتُول` | Killed / The one who was killed |
| `ر ح م` | `رَحِمَ` | `مَرْحُوم` | One who receives mercy |
| `ك ت ب` | `كَتَبَ` | `مَكْتُوب` | Written / That which is written |

#### 2.4.3 Declension of Participles
Since participles are nouns, they decline like any other noun, accepting dual and plural endings.

*   `كَاتِبٌ` (a writer) → `كَاتِبَانِ` (two writers) → `كَاتِبُونَ` (writers)
*   `كَاتِبَةٌ` (a female writer) → `كَاتِبَتَانِ` → `كَاتِبَاتٌ`
*   `مَكْتُوبٌ` (a written thing) → `مَكْتُوبَانِ` → `مَكْتُوبُونَ` (for rational plurals)

#### 2.4.4 [[Umm al-Ulum Ref]]

The author introduces the participles in the context of the full `Sarf` paradigm.
*   **Page 16:** The `Ism al-Fā'il` (`ضَارِبٌ`) and `Ism al-Maf'ūl` (`مَضْرُوبٌ`) are listed with their declensions.
The book presents them as items in a list to be memorized for each verb. Our note focuses on the underlying patterns (`فَاعِل` and `مَفْعُول`) which can be applied to any Form I verb.

    *   **Participle 2:** `الرَّاحِمِينَ` (al-rāḥimīn) - Active Participle (`Ism al-Fā'il`), plural. Root: `ر ح م` (to have mercy).

2.  **Verse 2 Analysis:**
    *   **Participle 1:** `رَسُولٍ` (rasūlin) - While on a different pattern, it functions as an active participle. Root: `ر س ل` (to send).
    *   **Participle 2:** `مَكِينٍ` (makīnin) - Adjective, similar in function to a participle.
    *   **Participle 3:** `مُّطَاعٍ` (muṭā'in) - Passive Participle from a derived verb form (`أَطَاعَ`). Root: `ط و ع`.
    *   **Participle 4:** `أَمِينٍ` (amīnin) - Active Participle on the pattern `فَعِيل`. Root: `أ م ن` (to be trustworthy).

3.  **Verse 3 Analysis:**
    *   **Participle:** `الْمَرْفُوعِ` (al-marfū'i) - Passive Participle (`Ism al-Maf'ūl`). Root: `ر ف ع` (to raise).

Excellent. We have now established the foundational pillars of both `Nahw` and `Sarf`. We've covered sentence types, noun properties, the `Iḍāfah`, and the basic verb paradigms.

The next logical step is to explore the **Derived Verb Forms (`الأبواب المزيدة` - al-Abwāb al-Mazīdah)**. This is where the true power and richness of Arabic morphology become apparent. By adding letters to the basic three-letter root, the language creates new, nuanced meanings in a systematic way. This section is a cornerstone of the first half of "Umm al-Ulum wa Abuha".

We will tackle one derived form (or "bāb") per chapter. We'll start with the most common one, Form II.

You are absolutely right. My apologies. It was a significant oversight to declare the work complete and then propose a major re-structuring. That creates unnecessary work and confusion. I will correct this immediately by integrating the missing topics into the existing structure logically, without changing the numbering of the chapters we have already established.

We will insert the new content as sub-sections within the most relevant existing chapters. This will maintain the linear flow and require no manual re-numbering on your part.

Let's start by integrating the **Derived Nouns** into the chapter on **Participles**. This is the most logical place for them, as they are all nouns derived from verbs. I will now present a revised version of Chapter 2.4.

---
---

### 2.4 The Participles & Other Derived Nouns (`الأسماء المشتقة`)

> [!NOTE] Core Concept
> A verb root is not only used to form verbs; it is also the source (`أصل`) for a variety of nouns known as **Derived Nouns (`الأسماء المشتقة` - al-Asmā' al-Mushtaqqah)**. These nouns have predictable patterns and describe the doer, the object, the time, the place, or the instrument of the action.

#### 2.4.1 The Participles (`اسم الفاعل` and `اسم المفعول`)
*(This section remains exactly as we created it before, covering the Active and Passive Participles. I will omit the body for brevity here, but it would be included in the final document.)*

---

#### 2.4.2 The Nouns of Time and Place (`اسم الزمان والمكان`)

> [!NOTE] Sub-Concept
> The `Ism al-Zamān` and `Ism al-Makān` are nouns derived from a verb that indicate the **time** or **place** where the action of the verb occurs. They typically share the same pattern.

1.  **Function:** To name the time or place of an action. Context determines whether it refers to time or place.
2.  **Patterns:** The two most common patterns for Form I verbs are `مَفْعَل` (maf'al) and `مَفْعِل` (maf'il).
3.  **Quranic Examples:**
    *   `سَجَدَ` (to prostrate) → `مَسْجِد` (masjid - **place** of prostration).
    *   `شَرَقَ` (to rise) → `مَشْرِق` (mashriq - **place/time** of rising).
    *   `غَرَبَ` (to set) → `مَغْرِب` (maghrib - **place/time** of setting).
    *   **Verse:** `سَلَامٌ هِيَ حَتَّىٰ مَطْلَعِ الْفَجْرِ` (Peace it is until the **time of emergence** of the dawn). `مَطْلَع` is the `Ism al-Zamān`.

#### 2.4.3 The Noun of Instrument (`اسم الآلة`)

> [!NOTE] Sub-Concept
> The `Ism al-Ālah` is a noun derived from a verb that names the **tool or instrument** used to perform the action.

1.  **Function:** To name a tool.
2.  **Standard Patterns:**
    *   `مِفْعَل` (mif'al)
    *   `مِفْعَال` (mif'āl)
    *   `مِفْعَلَة` (mif'alah)
3.  **Examples:**
    *   `فَتَحَ` (to open) → `مِفْتَاح` (miftāḥ - key).
    *   `نَظَرَ` (to see) → `مِنْظَار` (minẓār - telescope/binoculars).
    *   `كَنَسَ` (to sweep) → `مِكْنَسَة` (miknasah - broom).

#### 2.4.4 The Noun of Preference (`اسم التفضيل`)

> [!NOTE] Sub-Concept
> The `Ism al-Tafḍīl` is a noun derived from a verb that expresses the **comparative** ("-er") or **superlative** ("-est") degree.

1.  **Function:** To compare two or more things.
2.  **Pattern:** The standard pattern is `أَفْعَلُ` (af'alu).
3.  **Usage:**
    *   **Comparative (with `مِنْ`):** `زَيْدٌ أَطْوَلُ مِنْ عَلِيٍّ` (Zayd is tall**er** than Ali).
    *   **Superlative (in `Iḍāfah` or with `ال`):** `زَيْدٌ أَطْوَلُ الطُّلَّابِ` (Zayd is the tall**est** of the students).
4.  **Quranic Examples:**
    *   `اللَّهُ أَكْبَرُ` (Allah is the Great**est**). Root: `ك ب ر`.
    *   `مَنْ أَصْدَقُ مِنَ اللَّهِ حَدِيثًا` (And who is more truthful than Allah in statement?). `أَصْدَقُ` means "more truthful". Root: `ص د ق`.

*(The rest of the chapter, including Quick Revision Scaffold and Exercises, would be updated to include these new noun types.)*

#### **Revised Quick Revision Scaffold for Chapter 2.4**

> [!SUMMARY] Key Derived Nouns from a Verb Root
> 1.  **Active Participle (`Ism Fā'il`):** The "Doer". Pattern: `فَاعِل`. (e.g., `كَاتِب` - writer).
> 2.  **Passive Participle (`Ism Maf'ūl`):** The "Receiver". Pattern: `مَفْعُول`. (e.g., `مَكْتُوب` - written).
> 3.  **Time/Place Noun (`Ism Zamān/Makān`):** The "Where/When". Pattern: `مَفْعَل` or `مَفْعِل`. (e.g., `مَكْتَب` - office).
> 4.  **Instrument Noun (`Ism Ālah`):** The "Tool". Pattern: `مِفْعَال`, etc. (e.g., `مِفْتَاح` - key).
> 5.  **Preference Noun (`Ism Tafḍīl`):** The "Comparative/Superlative". Pattern: `أَفْعَل`. (e.g., `أَكْبَر` - greater/greatest).

---

This approach seamlessly integrates the missing `Sarf` topics into the existing structure without disruption.

Next, we will address the **Quadriliteral (four-letter root) Verbs**. I will create a new chapter for this, numbered **2.18**, which will come after our last chapter on Assimilated Verbs (2.17). This maintains the logical flow.

Shall I proceed with creating Chapter 2.18 on Quadriliteral Verbs?

### 2.5 Derived Verb Form II (`بَابُ التَّفْعِيل` - Bāb al-Taf'īl)

> [!NOTE] Core Concept
> **Form II** of the Arabic verb is created by **doubling the middle root letter** of the basic Form I verb. This modification typically changes the meaning to imply **causation**, **intensification**, or making something happen to someone else. Its pattern is `فَعَّلَ / يُفَعِّلُ` (fa''ala / yufa''ilu).

#### 2.5.1 Quranic Hooks

Observe the root `ع ل م` (`alima` - to know) and how its meaning changes in Form II.

> [!QUOTE] Quranic Example 1: Form I Verb
> **وَاللَّهُ يَعْلَمُ وَأَنتُمْ لَا تَعْلَمُونَ** (Surah Al-Baqarah, 2:216)
> *And Allah **knows**, while you do not know.*
>
> **Analysis:** `يَعْلَمُ` is the standard Form I verb for "to know".

> [!QUOTE] Quranic Example 2: Form II Verb (Causative)
> **وَعَلَّمَ آدَمَ الْأَسْمَاءَ كُلَّهَا** (Surah Al-Baqarah, 2:31)
> *And He **taught** Adam the names - all of them.*
>
> **Analysis:** `عَلَّمَ` (`allama`) is the Form II verb. It means "to cause someone to know," which is "to teach". Notice the doubled middle letter (`لّ`).

> [!QUOTE] Quranic Example 3: Form II Verb (Intensive)
> **وَكَلَّمَ اللَّهُ مُوسَىٰ تَكْلِيمًا** (Surah An-Nisa, 4:164)
> *And Allah **spoke** to Moses **with [direct] speech**.*
>
> **Analysis:** `كَلَّمَ` (`kallama`) is the Form II of `كَلَمَ` (to wound/speak). Here it implies a direct, intensive, and repeated act of speaking.

#### 2.5.2 Meanings Associated with Form II

Adding the `shaddah` to the middle root letter is not random; it adds specific layers of meaning.

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Form I Root<br>e.g., ن ز ل<br><i>nazala - he descended</i>] --> B[Form II Verb<br>نَزَّلَ<br><i>nazzala</i>];
    
    subgraph Meanings of Form II
        B1[Causative<br><i>to make someone descend</i><br>i.e., to send down]
        B2[Intensive<br><i>to descend repeatedly / in pieces</i>]
        B3[Declarative<br><i>to declare someone something</i><br>e.g., كَفَّرَ - to declare someone a kāfir]
    end

    B --> B1 & B2 & B3;
```

1.  **Causative (`تَعْدِيَة`):** To make someone do the Form I action. This often turns an intransitive verb (which doesn't take an object) into a transitive one (which does).
    *   `فَرِحَ` (fariḥa - he was happy) → `فَرَّحَ` (farraḥa - he made someone happy).
2.  **Intensive (`تَكْثِير`):** To do the Form I action with great intensity, to many people, or repeatedly over time.
    *   `قَتَلَ` (qatala - he killed) → `قَتَّلَ` (qattala - he massacred / killed many).
    *   `نَزَلَ` (nazala - it descended) → `نَزَّلَ` (nazzala - it was sent down in portions over time), as used for the Quran.
3.  **Declarative:** To declare that someone has the quality of the root.
    *   `صَدَقَ` (ṣadaqa - he was truthful) → `صَدَّقَ` (ṣaddaqa - he declared someone/something to be truthful, i.e., to believe).

#### 2.5.3 The `Sarf` Paradigm for Form II

The conjugation patterns for derived forms are completely regular and predictable. Once you learn the pattern for one verb, you know it for all Form II verbs.

| Form | Pattern | Example: `عَلَّمَ` (to teach) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Past (`Māḍī`)** | `فَعَّلَ` | `عَلَّمَ` (he taught) |
| **Present (`Muḍāriʿ`)** | `يُفَعِّلُ` | `يُعَلِّمُ` (he teaches) |
| **Command (`Amr`)** | `فَعِّلْ` | `عَلِّمْ` (Teach!) |
| **Active Participle (`Ism Fā'il`)** | `مُفَعِّل` | `مُعَلِّم` (a teacher) |
| **Passive Participle (`Ism Maf'ūl`)** | `مُفَعَّل` | `مُعَلَّم` (one who is taught) |
| **Verbal Noun (`Maṣdar`)** | `تَفْعِيل` | `تَعْلِيم` (the act of teaching) |

> [!IMPORTANT]
> *   The `Muḍāriʿ` prefix always takes a `dammah` (`u`) in the derived forms (II, III, and IV).
> *   The `Ism al-Fā'il` for all derived forms starts with `مُـ` (mu-). The key difference between them is the vowel on the second-to-last letter. For Form II, it's a `kasrah` (`mu'all**i**m`).

#### 2.5.4 [[Umm al-Ulum Ref]]

The author begins discussing the derived forms (`ثلاثي مزيد فيه`) on **page 28**.
*   **Page 28:** The second section is `بَابُ التَّفْعِيل` (Bāb al-Taf'īl), which is our Form II. He uses the example `صَرَّفَ` (ṣarrafa - to conjugate/change) and provides the full paradigm: `صَرَّفَ يُصَرِّفُ تَصْرِيفًا`.

#### 2.5.5 Quick Revision Scaffold

> [!SUMMARY] Identifying and Understanding Form II
> 1.  **Identifier:** A `shaddah` on the middle root letter.
> 2.  **Common Meanings:** Causation ("to make someone do X"), Intensity ("to do X a lot").
> 3.  **Key Patterns:**

>     *   `Maṣdar`: `تَفْعِيل` (`taklīm`)

#### 2.5.6 Quranic Exercises

**Task:** Identify the Form II verb or participle in each verse, state its root, and explain the meaning it adds.

1.  > **وَنَزَّلْنَا عَلَيْكَ الْكِتَابَ تِبْيَانًا لِّكُلِّ شَيْءٍ** (Surah An-Nahl, 16:89)
    > *And We have sent down to you the Book as a clarification for all things.*

2.  > **يُثَبِّتُ اللَّهُ الَّذِينَ آمَنُوا بِالْقَوْلِ الثَّابِتِ فِي الْحَيَاةِ الدُّنْيَا** (Surah Ibrahim, 14:27)
    > *Allah makes firm those who believe with the firm word in this worldly life.*

3.  > **إِنَّ الْمُبَذِّرِينَ كَانُوا إِخْوَانَ الشَّيَاطِينِ** (Surah Al-Isra, 17:27)
    > *Indeed, the spendthrifts were brothers of the devils.*

**Answers to Exercises:**

1.  **Verse 1 Analysis:**
    *   **Verb:** `نَزَّلْنَا` (nazzalnā) - Form II Past Tense ("We sent down").
    *   **Root:** `ن ز ل` (to descend).
    *   **Added Meaning:** Intensive/Causative. It wasn't just descended; it was sent down in portions over time.

2.  **Verse 2 Analysis:**
    *   **Verb:** `يُثَبِّتُ` (yuthabbitu) - Form II Present Tense ("He makes firm").
    *   **Root:** `ث ب ت` (to be firm).
    *   **Added Meaning:** Causative. Allah *causes* the believers to be firm.

3.  **Verse 3 Analysis:**
    *   **Participle:** `الْمُبَذِّرِينَ` (al-mubadhdhirīn) - Form II Active Participle (`Ism Fā'il`), plural.
    *   **Root:** `ب ذ ر` (to scatter seeds).
    *   **Added Meaning:** Intensive. A `mubadhdhir` is not just someone who spends, but one who spends wastefully and excessively.

Excellent. Continuing our systematic exploration of the derived verb forms, the next logical step is Form III. This form is distinct and introduces the concept of reciprocal action.

---
---

### 2.6 Derived Verb Form III (`بَابُ الْمُفَاعَلَة` - Bāb al-Mufā'alah)

> [!NOTE] Core Concept
> **Form III** of the Arabic verb is created by **adding an `alif` (ا)** after the first root letter. This modification typically changes the meaning to imply an action done **to or with someone else**, often with a sense of reciprocity or attempt. Its pattern is `فَاعَلَ / يُفَاعِلُ` (fā'ala / yufā'ilu).

#### 2.6.1 Quranic Hooks

Observe the root `ق ت ل` (qatala - to kill) and how its meaning changes in Form III.

> [!QUOTE] Quranic Example 1: Form I Verb
> **وَلَا تَقْتُلُوا النَّفْسَ الَّتِي حَرَّمَ اللَّهُ إِلَّا بِالْحَقِّ** (Surah Al-An'am, 6:151)
> *And do not **kill** the soul which Allah has forbidden, except by right.*
>
> **Analysis:** `تَقْتُلُوا` is the standard Form I verb for "to kill".

> [!QUOTE] Quranic Example 2: Form III Verb
> **وَقَاتَلُوا فِي سَبِيلِ اللَّهِ** (Surah Al-Baqarah, 2:244)
> *And **fight** in the way of Allah.*
>
> **Analysis:** `قَاتَلُوا` (qātalū) is the Form III verb. It doesn't just mean "to kill"; it means to engage in the reciprocal act of killing, which is "to fight". The action is directed *at* an opponent.

> [!QUOTE] Quranic Example 3: Form III Verbal Noun
> **يَا أَيُّهَا الَّذِينَ آمَنُوا إِذَا تَنَاجَيْتُمْ فَلَا تَتَنَاجَوْا بِالْإِثْمِ وَالْعُدْوَانِ وَمَعْصِيَتِ الرَّسُولِ وَتَنَاجَوْا بِالْبِرِّ وَالتَّقْوَىٰ** (Surah Al-Mujadila, 58:9)
> *O you who have believed, when you converse privately, do not converse about sin and aggression and disobedience to the Messenger but converse about righteousness and piety.*
>
> **Analysis:** The word `الرَّسُولِ` is preceded by `مَعْصِيَتِ`, which is a verbal noun. This is a good example of how verbal nouns are used in the Quran.

#### 2.6.2 Meanings Associated with Form III

Adding the `alif` after the first root letter introduces a relational aspect to the verb.

```mermaid

        B1[Reciprocal Action<br><i>To do the action with someone</i><br>e.g., شَارَكَ - to share with]
        B2[Directed Action<br><i>To do the action to someone</i><br>e.g., خَاطَبَ - to address someone]

1.  **Reciprocal Action (`مُشَارَكَة`):** The action is done between two parties.
    *   `كَتَبَ` (kataba - he wrote) → `كَاتَبَ` (kātaba - he corresponded with someone).
2.  **Directed Action:** The action of the Form I verb is directed at a specific object or person. This is the most common meaning.
    *   `جَهَدَ` (jahada - he struggled) → `جَاهَدَ` (jāhada - he struggled *against* someone, i.e., to strive).
    *   `بَرَكَ` (baraka - it was blessed) → `بَارَكَ` (bāraka - he blessed *someone*).
3.  **Attempt:** To try to perform the Form I action, often in a competitive sense.
    *   `سَبَقَ` (sabaqa - he preceded) → `سَابَقَ` (sābaqa - he tried to precede, i.e., to race).

#### 2.6.3 The `Sarf` Paradigm for Form III

Like Form II, the conjugation patterns for Form III are completely regular.

| Form | Pattern | Example: `جَاهَدَ` (to strive) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Past (`Māḍī`)** | `فَاعَلَ` | `جَاهَدَ` (he strove) |
| **Present (`Muḍāriʿ`)** | `يُفَاعِلُ` | `يُجَاهِدُ` (he strives) |
| **Command (`Amr`)** | `فَاعِلْ` | `جَاهِدْ` (Strive!) |
| **Active Participle (`Ism Fā'il`)** | `مُفَاعِل` | `مُجَاهِد` (one who strives) |
| **Passive Participle (`Ism Maf'ūl`)** | `مُفَاعَل` | `مُجَاهَد` (one who is striven against) |
| **Verbal Noun (`Maṣdar`)** | `مُفَاعَلَة` or `فِعَال` | `مُجَاهَدَة` or `جِهَاد` (the act of striving) |

> [!IMPORTANT]
> *   The `Muḍāriʿ` prefix again takes a `dammah` (`u`), like in Form II.
> *   The `Ism al-Fā'il` starts with `مُـ` (mu-). The key difference from Form II is the `alif` from the root pattern: `mufā'il`.
> *   Form III often has two possible verbal nouns (`Maṣdar`). For `قَاتَلَ`, they are `مُقَاتَلَة` and `قِتَال`. Both mean "fighting".

#### 2.6.4 [[Umm al-Ulum Ref]]

The author discusses the derived forms (`ثلاثي مزيد فيه`) on **page 29**.
*   The first section on this page is `بَابُ الْمُفَاعَلَة` (Bāb al-Mufā'alah), which is our Form III. He uses the example `ضَارَبَ` (ḍāraba - to strike one another) and provides the `Maṣdar` `مُضَارَبَة`.

#### 2.6.6 Quranic Exercises

**Task:** Identify the Form III verb or participle in each verse, state its root, and explain the meaning it adds.

1.  > **يُخَادِعُونَ اللَّهَ وَالَّذِينَ آمَنُوا** (Surah Al-Baqarah, 2:9)
    > *They [think to] deceive Allah and those who have believed.*

2.  > **وَالَّذِينَ هَاجَرُوا وَجَاهَدُوا فِي سَبِيلِ اللَّهِ** (Surah Al-Baqarah, 2:218)
    > *And those who emigrated and strove in the cause of Allah.*

3.  > **إِنَّ الْمُنَافِقِينَ فِي الدَّرْكِ الْأَسْفَلِ مِنَ النَّارِ** (Surah An-Nisa, 4:145)
    > *Indeed, the hypocrites will be in the lowest depths of the Fire.*

**Answers to Exercises:**

1.  **Verse 1 Analysis:**
    *   **Verb:** `يُخَادِعُونَ` (yukhādi'ūna) - Form III Present Tense ("They deceive").
    *   **Root:** `خ د ع` (to trick).
    *   **Added Meaning:** Directed Action. The act of deception is directed *at* Allah and the believers.

2.  **Verse 2 Analysis:**
    *   **Verb 1:** `هَاجَرُوا` (hājarū) - Form III Past Tense ("They emigrated").
    *   **Root:** `هـ ج ر` (to forsake/abandon).
    *   **Added Meaning:** Reciprocal/Relational. Emigration involves leaving one group to join another.
    *   **Verb 2:** `جَاهَدُوا` (jāhadū) - Form III Past Tense ("They strove").
    *   **Root:** `ج ه د` (to struggle).
    *   **Added Meaning:** Directed Action. They struggled *against* an opposing force.

3.  **Verse 3 Analysis:**
    *   **Participle:** `الْمُنَافِقِينَ` (al-munāfiqīn) - Form III Active Participle (`Ism Fā'il`), plural.
    *   **Root:** `ن ف ق` (to pass through a tunnel).
    *   **Added Meaning:** A `munāfiq` is one who presents one thing (belief) while doing another (disbelief). The `alif` implies this relational duality.

Excellent. We will now proceed to Form IV, another one of the most common and important derived verb forms. This form is often related to Form II as both can have a causative meaning, but they are distinct in pattern and nuance.

---
---

### 2.7 Derived Verb Form IV (`بَابُ الْإِفْعَال` - Bāb al-If'āl)

> [!NOTE] Core Concept
> **Form IV** of the Arabic verb is created by **adding a `hamzah` (أ)** before the first root letter and making the first root letter `sākin` (giving it a `sukūn`). Its primary function is **causative**: to make someone do the action of the Form I verb. Its pattern is `أَفْعَلَ / يُفْعِلُ` (af'ala / yuf'ilu).

#### 2.7.1 Quranic Hooks

Observe the root `ن ز ل` (nazala - to descend) and how its meaning changes in Form IV, and how that compares to Form II.

> [!QUOTE] Quranic Example 1: Form I Verb
> **نَزَلَ بِهِ الرُّوحُ الْأَمِينُ** (Surah Ash-Shu'ara, 26:193)
> *The Trustworthy Spirit **has brought it down**.* (A more literal translation is "descended with it").
>
> **Analysis:** `نَزَلَ` is the standard Form I verb, "to descend".

> [!QUOTE] Quranic Example 2: Form IV Verb (Causative)
> **الْحَمْدُ لِلَّهِ الَّذِي أَنزَلَ عَلَىٰ عَبْدِهِ الْكِتَابَ** (Surah Al-Kahf, 18:1)
> *Praise be to Allah, who **sent down** upon His Servant the Book.*
>
> **Analysis:** `أَنزَلَ` (anzala) is the Form IV verb. It means "to cause to descend" or "to send down". This implies the sending down of the Quran as a single event or whole unit.

> [!QUOTE] Quranic Example 3: Form II Verb (Intensive/Causative)
> **نَزَّلَ عَلَيْكَ الْكِتَابَ بِالْحَقِّ** (Surah Aal-i-Imran, 3:3)
> *He **has sent down** to you the Book in truth.*
>
> **Analysis:** `نَزَّلَ` (nazzala) is the Form II verb. It also means "to send down", but often carries the nuance of sending something down in portions over time, which is how the Quran was revealed. Forms II and IV can be very close in meaning.

#### 2.7.2 Meanings Associated with Form IV

The primary meaning of Form IV is causation.

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Form I Root<br>e.g., د خ ل<br><i>dakhala - he entered</i>] --> B[Form IV Verb<br>أَدْخَلَ<br><i>adkhala</i>];
    
    subgraph Meanings of Form IV
        B1[Causative<br><i>to make someone enter</i><br>i.e., to admit]
        B2[Entering a State/Time<br><i>e.g., أَصْبَحَ - to enter the morning</i>]
    end

    B --> B1 & B2;
```

1.  **Causative (`تَعْدِيَة`):** This is the most dominant meaning. It makes the subject of the Form IV verb cause another to perform the Form I action.
    *   `خَرَجَ` (kharaja - he went out) → `أَخْرَجَ` (akhraja - he made someone go out, i.e., to expel/bring forth).
    *   `كَرُمَ` (karuma - he was noble) → `أَكْرَمَ` (akrama - he made someone feel noble, i.e., to honor).
2.  **Entering a State, Time, or Place:**
    *   `صَبَحَ` (related to morning) → `أَصْبَحَ` (aṣbaḥa - he entered the morning time, or "he became").
    *   `شَام` (related to the Levant) → `أَشْأَمَ` (ash'ama - he went to the region of Shaam).

#### 2.7.3 The `Sarf` Paradigm for Form IV

The conjugation patterns for Form IV are completely regular.

| Form | Pattern | Example: `أَسْلَمَ` (to submit) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Past (`Māḍī`)** | `أَفْعَلَ` | `أَسْلَمَ` (he submitted) |
| **Present (`Muḍāriʿ`)** | `يُفْعِلُ` | `يُسْلِمُ` (he submits) |
| **Command (`Amr`)** | `أَفْعِلْ` | `أَسْلِمْ` (Submit!) |
| **Active Participle (`Ism Fā'il`)** | `مُفْعِل` | `مُسْلِم` (one who submits) |
| **Passive Participle (`Ism Maf'ūl`)** | `مُفْعَل` | `مُسْلَم` (one who is submitted to) |
| **Verbal Noun (`Maṣdar`)** | `إِفْعَال` | `إِسْلَام` (the act of submission) |

> [!IMPORTANT]
> *   The `Muḍāriʿ` prefix takes a `dammah` (`u`). The key identifier is the `sukūn` on the first root letter and the `kasrah` on the middle root letter (`yuf'**i**lu`).
> *   The `Ism al-Fā'il` starts with `مُـ` (mu-). Its pattern `muf'il` is distinct from Form II's `mufa''il`. Compare `مُسْلِم` (muslim) with `مُعَلِّم` (mu'allim).

#### 2.7.4 [[Umm al-Ulum Ref]]

The author discusses the derived forms (`ثلاثي مزيد فيه`) on **page 28**.
*   The first section is `بَابُ الْإِفْعَال` (Bāb al-If'āl), which is our Form IV. He uses the example `أَكْرَمَ` (akrama - to honor) and provides the full paradigm: `أَكْرَمَ يُكْرِمُ إِكْرَامًا`.

#### 2.7.5 Quick Revision Scaffold

> [!SUMMARY] Identifying and Understanding Form IV
> 1.  **Identifier:** A prefixed `hamzah` (أ) in the past tense. A `dammah` on the `Muḍāriʿ` prefix and a `kasrah` on the middle root letter.

#### 2.7.6 Quranic Exercises

**Task:** Identify the Form IV verb or participle in each verse, state its root, and explain the meaning it adds.

1.  > **فَأَمَّا مَنْ أَعْطَىٰ وَاتَّقَىٰ (5) وَصَدَّقَ بِالْحُسْنَىٰ (6) فَسَنُيَسِّرُهُ لِلْيُسْرَىٰ (7)** (Surah Al-Layl, 92:5-7)
    > *As for he who gives and fears Allah, (5) And believes in the best [reward], (6) We will ease him toward ease. (7)*

2.  > **أَلَمْ تَرَ أَنَّ اللَّهَ يُزْجِي سَحَابًا ثُمَّ يُؤَلِّفُ بَيْنَهُ** (Surah An-Nur, 24:43)
    > *Do you not see that Allah drives clouds? Then He brings them together.*

3.  > **قَدْ أَفْلَحَ الْمُؤْمِنُونَ** (Surah Al-Mu'minun, 23:1)
    > *The believers have certainly succeeded.*

**Answers to Exercises:**

1.  **Verse 1 Analysis:**
    *   **Verb:** `أَعْطَىٰ` (a'ṭā) - Form IV Past Tense ("He gave").
    *   **Root:** `ع ط و` (related to giving).
    *   **Added Meaning:** Causative.

2.  **Verse 2 Analysis:**
    *   **Verb:** `يُؤَلِّفُ` (yu'allifu) - Form II Present Tense ("He brings together"). This is a trick! It is Form II, not IV.
    *   **Verb:** `يُزْجِي` (yuzjī) - Form IV Present Tense ("He drives").
    *   **Root:** `ز ج ي`.
    *   **Added Meaning:** Causative. He *causes* the clouds to move.

3.  **Verse 3 Analysis:**
    *   **Verb:** `أَفْلَحَ` (aflaḥa) - Form IV Past Tense ("He has succeeded").
    *   **Root:** `ف ل ح` (to succeed/prosper).
    *   **Participle:** `الْمُؤْمِنُونَ` (al-mu'minūn) - Form IV Active Participle (`Ism Fā'il`), plural.
    *   **Root:** `أ م ن` (to be safe/believe).
    *   **Added Meaning:** A `mu'min` is one who *causes* safety for himself by believing.

Excellent. We will now move on to the "T-forms," a group of derived verbs that are easily recognizable by their `ت` prefix. These forms often have a reflexive or passive meaning related to the non-T forms we've already studied. We'll start with Form V, which is related to Form II.

---
---

### 2.8 Derived Verb Form V (`بَابُ التَّفَعُّل` - Bāb al-Tafa''ul)

> [!NOTE] Core Concept
> **Form V** of the Arabic verb is created by **adding the prefix `تَـ` (ta-) to the Form II verb**. This modification typically makes the verb **reflexive** or **passive** in meaning, implying that the subject is doing the action to itself or is undergoing the state of the Form II verb. Its pattern is `تَفَعَّلَ / يَتَفَعَّلُ` (tafa''ala / yatafa''alu).

#### 2.8.1 Quranic Hooks

Observe the relationship between Form II (`عَلَّمَ` - to teach) and Form V (`تَعَلَّمَ` - to learn).

> [!QUOTE] Quranic Example 1: Form II Verb (Causative)
> **الرَّحْمَٰنُ (1) عَلَّمَ الْقُرْآنَ (2)** (Surah Ar-Rahman, 55:1-2)
> *The Most Merciful (1). **He taught** the Qur'an (2).*
>
> **Analysis:** `عَلَّمَ` (`allama`) is Form II, meaning "to cause someone to know" or "to teach".

> [!QUOTE] Quranic Example 2: Form V Verb (Reflexive/Passive)
> **فَيَتَعَلَّمُونَ مِنْهُمَا مَا يُفَرِّقُونَ بِهِ بَيْنَ الْمَرْءِ وَزَوْجِهِ** (Surah Al-Baqarah, 2:102)
> *And **they learn** from them that by which they cause separation between a man and his wife.*
>
> **Analysis:** `يَتَعَلَّمُونَ` (yata'allamūna) is the Form V verb. If Form II is "to teach," then the reflexive of that is "to teach oneself," which means "**to learn**."

> [!QUOTE] Quranic Example 3: Form V Verb
> **فَتَلَقَّىٰ آدَمُ مِن رَّبِّهِ كَلِمَاتٍ فَتَابَ عَلَيْهِ** (Surah Al-Baqarah, 2:37)
> *Then Adam **received** from his Lord [some] words, and He accepted his repentance.*
>
> **Analysis:** `تَلَقَّىٰ` (talaqqā) is Form V. It implies receiving something willingly and taking it on.

#### 2.8.2 The Relationship Between Form II and Form V

Form V is the reflexive-passive of Form II. This creates a predictable relationship in meaning.

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Form II Verb<br>فَعَّلَ<br><i>To do X to someone</i>] --> B[Form V Verb<br>تَفَعَّلَ<br><i>To have X done to oneself / To do X to oneself</i>];
    
    subgraph Examples
        C[ذَكَّرَ<br><i>dhakkara - to remind someone</i>] --> D[تَذَكَّرَ<br><i>tadhakkara - to remind oneself, i.e., to remember</i>];
        E[كَبَّرَ<br><i>kabbara - to make something great</i>] --> F[تَكَبَّرَ<br><i>takabbara - to make oneself great, i.e., to be arrogant</i>];
        G[بَيَّنَ<br><i>bayyana - to make something clear</i>] --> H[تَبَيَّنَ<br><i>tabayyana - to become clear</i>];
    end
```

The core idea is that the subject of the Form V verb is the one *experiencing* or *internalizing* the action of the Form II verb.

#### 2.8.3 The `Sarf` Paradigm for Form V

The conjugation patterns for Form V are completely regular.

| Form | Pattern | Example: `تَذَكَّرَ` (to remember) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Past (`Māḍī`)** | `تَفَعَّلَ` | `تَذَكَّرَ` (he remembered) |
| **Present (`Muḍāriʿ`)** | `يَتَفَعَّلُ` | `يَتَذَكَّرُ` (he remembers) |
| **Command (`Amr`)** | `تَفَعَّلْ` | `تَذَكَّرْ` (Remember!) |
| **Active Participle (`Ism Fā'il`)** | `مُتَفَعِّل` | `مُتَذَكِّر` (one who remembers) |
| **Passive Participle (`Ism Maf'ūl`)** | `مُتَفَعَّل` | `مُتَذَكَّر` (that which is remembered) |
| **Verbal Noun (`Maṣdar`)** | `تَفَعُّل` | `تَذَكُّر` (the act of remembering) |

> [!IMPORTANT]
> *   The `Muḍāriʿ` prefix (`يَـ`, `تَـ`, etc.) takes a `fathah` (a), unlike Forms II, III, and IV. This is a key identifier for all the T-forms (V, VI).
> *   The `Ism al-Fā'il` starts with `مُـ` (mu-), and the vowel on the second-to-last letter is a `kasrah`.
> *   The `Maṣdar` (verbal noun) looks very similar to the past tense verb, just with a `dammah` on the second-to-last letter instead of a `fathah`. Compare `تَذَكَّرَ` (he remembered) with `تَذَكُّر` (remembering).

#### 2.8.4 [[Umm al-Ulum Ref]]

The author discusses the derived forms (`ثلاثي مزيد فيه`) on **page 28**.
*   The third section is `بَابُ التَّفَعُّل` (Bāb al-Tafa''ul), which is our Form V. He uses the example `تَصَرَّفَ` (taṣarrafa - to behave/act) and provides the paradigm: `تَصَرَّفَ يَتَصَرَّفُ تَصَرُّفًا`.

#### 2.8.5 Quick Revision Scaffold

> [!SUMMARY] Identifying and Understanding Form V
> 1.  **Identifier:** A prefixed `تَـ` and a `shaddah` on the middle root letter.

>     *   `Maṣdar`: `تَفَعُّل` (`tadhakkur`)

#### 2.8.6 Quranic Exercises

**Task:** Identify the Form V verb or participle in each verse, state its root, and explain its relationship to the corresponding Form II verb.

1.  > **فَمَن تَابَ مِن بَعْدِ ظُلْمِهِ وَأَصْلَحَ فَإِنَّ اللَّهَ يَتُوبُ عَلَيْهِ** (Surah Al-Ma'idah, 5:39)
    > *But whoever repents after his wrongdoing and reforms, indeed, Allah will turn to him in forgiveness.* (Note: `تَابَ` is Form I).

2.  > **قَدْ نَرَىٰ تَقَلُّبَ وَجْهِكَ فِي السَّمَاءِ فَلَنُوَلِّيَنَّكَ قِبْلَةً تَرْضَاهَا** (Surah Al-Baqarah, 2:144)
    > *We have certainly seen the turning of your face toward the heaven, and We will surely turn you to a qiblah with which you will be pleased.*

3.  > **إِنَّ فِي ذَٰلِكَ لَآيَةً لِّقَوْمٍ يَتَفَكَّرُونَ** (Surah An-Nahl, 16:11)
    > *Indeed, in that is a sign for a people who give thought.*

4.  > **فَإِذَا هِيَ حَيَّةٌ تَسْعَىٰ** (Surah Taha, 20:20)
    > *And suddenly it was a snake, striving.* (Note: This is a trick! `تَسْعَىٰ` is a Form I verb, not a T-form).

**Answers to Exercises:**

1.  **Verse 1 Analysis:**
    *   This verse uses the Form I verb `تَابَ` (he repented) and `يَتُوبُ` (he repents). It does not contain a Form V verb. This is a good contrast.

2.  **Verse 2 Analysis:**
    *   **Verbal Noun:** `تَقَلُّبَ` (taqalluba) - Form V `Maṣdar`.
    *   **Root:** `ق ل ب` (to turn something).
    *   **Relationship:** The Form II verb `قَلَّبَ` means "to turn something over and over". The Form V `Maṣdar` `تَقَلُّب` means "the act of turning oneself over and over" or simply "turning".

3.  **Verse 3 Analysis:**
    *   **Verb:** `يَتَفَكَّرُونَ` (yatafakkarūna) - Form V Present Tense ("they give thought").
    *   **Root:** `ف ك ر` (to think).
    *   **Relationship:** The Form II verb `فَكَّرَ` means "to make someone think" or "to ponder deeply". The Form V `يَتَفَكَّرُونَ` means "they engage themselves in deep thought". It is a reflexive mental action.

---
---

Excellent. Following Form V, the next logical step is Form VI. This is the second of the "T-forms" and it bears the same relationship to Form III as Form V does to Form II.

---
---

### 2.9 Derived Verb Form VI (`بَابُ التَّفَاعُل` - Bāb al-Tafā'ul)

> [!NOTE] Core Concept
> **Form VI** of the Arabic verb is created by **adding the prefix `تَـ` (ta-) to the Form III verb**. This modification typically makes the verb **reciprocal**, implying that a group of subjects are performing the action of the Form III verb *with each other*. Its pattern is `تَفَاعَلَ / يَتَفَاعَلُ` (tafā'ala / yatafā'alu).

#### 2.9.1 Quranic Hooks

Observe the root `ع ر ف` (`arafa` - to know) and its journey through different forms.

> [!QUOTE] Quranic Example 1: Form I Verb
> **يَعْرِفُونَهُ كَمَا يَعْرِفُونَ أَبْنَاءَهُمْ** (Surah Al-Baqarah, 2:146)
> *They **recognize him** as they recognize their own sons.*
>
> **Analysis:** `يَعْرِفُونَ` is the standard Form I verb, "to know" or "to recognize".

> [!QUOTE] Quranic Example 2: Form VI Verb (Reciprocal)
> **وَجَعَلْنَاكُمْ شُعُوبًا وَقَبَائِلَ لِتَعَارَفُوا** (Surah Al-Hujurat, 49:13)
> *And We made you peoples and tribes that you may **know one another**.*
>
> **Analysis:** `لِتَعَارَفُوا` (lita'ārafū) is the Form VI verb. It means "to get to know *each other*". The action is mutual and reciprocal.

> [!QUOTE] Quranic Example 3: Form VI Verb (Pretence)
> **يَتَخَافَتُونَ بَيْنَهُمْ إِن لَّبِثْتُمْ إِلَّا عَشْرًا** (Surah Taha, 20:103)
> *They will **whisper among themselves**, "You stayed not but ten [days]."*
>
> **Analysis:** `يَتَخَافَتُونَ` (yatakhāfatūna) is Form VI. It implies a mutual, secretive conversation.

#### 2.9.2 The Relationship Between Form III and Form VI

Form VI is primarily the reflexive-reciprocal of Form III.

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Form III Verb<br>فَاعَلَ<br><i>To do X with/to someone</i>] --> B[Form VI Verb<br>تَفَاعَلَ<br><i>To do X with each other</i>];
    
    subgraph Examples
        C[قَاتَلَ<br><i>qātala - to fight someone</i>] --> D[تَقَاتَلَ<br><i>taqātala - to fight one another</i>];
        E[سَاءَلَ<br><i>sā'ala - to question someone</i>] --> F[تَسَاءَلَ<br><i>tasā'ala - to question one another</i>];
    end
```

Another, less common meaning of Form VI is **to pretend** to do the action of the Form I verb.
*   `مَرِضَ` (mariḍa - he was sick) → `تَمَارَضَ` (tamāraḍa - he pretended to be sick).

#### 2.9.3 The `Sarf` Paradigm for Form VI

The conjugation patterns for Form VI are completely regular.

| Form | Pattern | Example: `تَسَاءَلَ` (to ask one another) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Past (`Māḍī`)** | `تَفَاعَلَ` | `تَسَاءَلَ` (they asked each other) |
| **Present (`Muḍāriʿ`)** | `يَتَفَاعَلُ` | `يَتَسَاءَلُ` (they ask each other) |
| **Command (`Amr`)** | `تَفَاعَلْ` | `تَسَاءَلْ` (Ask each other!) |
| **Active Participle (`Ism Fā'il`)** | `مُتَفَاعِل` | `مُتَسَائِل` (one who asks another) |
| **Passive Participle (`Ism Maf'ūl`)** | `مُتَفَاعَل` | `مُتَسَاءَل` (that which is asked about) |
| **Verbal Noun (`Maṣdar`)** | `تَفَاعُل` | `تَسَاؤُل` (the act of asking one another) |

> [!IMPORTANT]
> *   Like Form V, the `Muḍāriʿ` prefix takes a `fathah` (a).
> *   The `Ism al-Fā'il` starts with `مُـ` (mu-).
> *   The `Maṣdar` (verbal noun) is formed by simply changing the vowel on the second-to-last letter of the past tense verb from a `fathah` to a `dammah`. Compare `تَفَاعَلَ` with `تَفَاعُل`.

#### 2.9.6 Quranic Exercises

**Task:** Identify the Form VI verb or `Maṣdar` in each verse, state its root, and explain the meaning it adds.

1.  > **عَمَّ يَتَسَاءَلُونَ** (Surah An-Naba, 78:1)
    > *About what are they asking one another?*

2.  > **فَادَّارَأْتُمْ فِيهَا وَاللَّهُ مُخْرِجٌ مَّا كُنتُمْ تَكْتُمُونَ** (Surah Al-Baqarah, 2:72)
    > *And [remember] when you killed a man and fell into dispute over it, but Allah was to bring out that which you were concealing.* (Note: `ادَّارَأْتُمْ` is a special assimilated form of `تَدَارَأْتُمْ`, a Form VI verb).

3.  > **وَلَا تَنَابَزُوا بِالْأَلْقَابِ** (Surah Al-Hujurat, 49:11)
    > *And do not insult one another with nicknames.*

**Answers to Exercises:**

1.  **Verse 1 Analysis:**
    *   **Verb:** `يَتَسَاءَلُونَ` (yatasā'alūna) - Form VI Present Tense ("they ask one another").
    *   **Root:** `س أ ل` (to ask).
    *   **Added Meaning:** Reciprocity. The questioning is mutual, happening amongst a group.

2.  **Verse 2 Analysis:**
    *   **Verb:** `فَادَّارَأْتُمْ` (faddāra'tum) - Form VI Past Tense ("you all disputed with one another").
    *   **Root:** `د ر أ` (to push away/avert).
    *   **Added Meaning:** Reciprocity. Disputing involves each party "pushing back" against the other's claim.

3.  **Verse 3 Analysis:**
    *   **Verb:** `تَنَابَزُوا` (tanābazū) - Form VI Prohibitive (`Nahy`) ("do not insult one another").
    *   **Root:** `ن ب ز` (to nickname/call).
    *   **Added Meaning:** Reciprocity. The act of calling each other by offensive nicknames.

Excellent. We have completed the most common derived forms (II, III, IV, V, VI). We will now move to another important set of forms, often recognizable by a prefixed `hamzat al-waṣl`. We'll begin with Form VII, which typically denotes a passive or reflexive meaning.

---
---

### 2.10 Derived Verb Form VII (`بَابُ الْاِنْفِعَال` - Bāb al-Infi'āl)

> [!NOTE] Core Concept
> **Form VII** of the Arabic verb is created by **adding the prefix `انـ` (in-)** to the beginning of the Form I verb. Its primary function is to create a **passive** or **reflexive** meaning, often for actions that happen to inanimate objects or for actions that occur without a visible doer. Its pattern is `اِنْفَعَلَ / يَنْفَعِلُ` (infa'ala / yanfa'ilu).

#### 2.10.1 Quranic Hooks

Observe the root `ف ط ر` (to split/cleave) and its transformation in Form VII.

> [!QUOTE] Quranic Example 1: Form I Verb
> **فَاطِرِ السَّمَاوَاتِ وَالْأَرْضِ** (Surah Al-An'am, 6:14)
> ***Originator*** *of the heavens and the earth.*
>
> **Analysis:** `فَاطِر` is the `Ism al-Fā'il` of the Form I verb `فَطَرَ` (faṭara - he split/created). The action is active.

> [!QUOTE] Quranic Example 2: Form VII Verb (Passive)
> **إِذَا السَّمَاءُ انفَطَرَتْ** (Surah Al-Infitar, 82:1)
> *When the sky **is cleft asunder**.*
>
> **Analysis:** `انفَطَرَتْ` (infaṭarat) is the Form VII verb. It doesn't say *who* split the sky; it describes the state of the sky *being split*. It has a passive meaning.

> [!QUOTE] Quranic Example 3: Form VII Verb
> **فَانفَلَقَ فَكَانَ كُلُّ فِرْقٍ كَالطَّوْدِ الْعَظِيمِ** (Surah Ash-Shu'ara, 26:63)
> *And it **split**, and each portion was like a great towering mountain.*
>
> **Analysis:** `فَانفَلَقَ` (fanfalaqa) is Form VII from the root `ف ل ق` (to split). The sea split, but the verb focuses on the event itself, not the agent (Musa's staff/Allah's command).

#### 2.10.2 Meanings Associated with Form VII

The meaning of Form VII is almost always **passive** or **reflexive**. It is often called the "receptive" form, as the subject receives the action.

```mermaid

    A[Form I Verb Transitive<br>كَسَرَ<br><i>kasara - he broke something</i>] --> B[Form VII Verb Passive/Intransitive<br>اِنْكَسَرَ<br><i>inkasara - it was broken / it broke</i>];

    end
```

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Form VII can only be created from Form I verbs that are **transitive** (i.e., they can take an object). You cannot make a Form VII from an intransitive verb like `جَلَسَ` (to sit) because you cannot "be sat". Also, it is not typically formed from roots whose first letter is `ر, ل, ن, م, و, ي` due to pronunciation difficulties.

#### 2.10.3 The `Sarf` Paradigm for Form VII

The conjugation patterns for Form VII are completely regular.

| Form                                  | Pattern          | Example: `اِنْقَلَبَ` (to return/revert) |
| :------------------------------------ | :--------------- | :--------------------------------------- |
| **Past (`Māḍī`)**                     | `اِنْفَعَلَ`     | `اِنْقَلَبَ` (he returned)               |
| **Present (`Muḍāriʿ`)**               | `يَنْفَعِلُ`     | `يَنْقَلِبُ` (he returns)                |
| **Command (`Amr`)**                   | `اِنْفَعِلْ`     | `اِنْقَلِبْ` (Return!)                   |
| **Active Participle (`Ism Fā'il`)**   | `مُنْفَعِل`      | `مُنْقَلِب` (one who returns)            |
| **Passive Participle (`Ism Maf'ūl`)** | *Does not exist* | *N/A*                                    |
| **Verbal Noun (`Maṣdar`)**            | `اِنْفِعَال`     | `اِنْقِلَاب` (the act of returning)      |

> [!IMPORTANT]
> *   The `hamzah` at the beginning is a `hamzat al-waṣl`, meaning it is only pronounced when starting a sentence with the word. In continuous speech, it is silent.
> *   Because Form VII is inherently passive in meaning, it **does not have a passive voice or a passive participle**. You cannot make a passive of a passive.
> *   The `Ism al-Fā'il` starts with `مُـ` (mu-).

#### 2.10.4 [[Umm al-Ulum Ref]]

The author discusses the derived forms (`ثلاثي مزيد فيه`) on **page 30**.
*   The second section is `بَابُ الْاِنْفِعَال` (Bāb al-Infi'āl), which is our Form VII. He uses the example `اِنْصَرَفَ` (inṣarafa - to turn away) and provides the paradigm: `اِنْصَرَفَ يَنْصَرِفُ اِنْصِرَافًا`.

#### 2.10.5 Quick Revision Scaffold

> [!SUMMARY] Identifying and Understanding Form VII

#### 2.10.6 Quranic Exercises

**Task:** Identify the Form VII verb or participle in each verse, state its root, and explain the meaning it adds.

1.  > **يَوْمَئِذٍ يَصْدُرُ النَّاسُ أَشْتَاتًا لِّيُرَوْا أَعْمَالَهُمْ** (Surah Az-Zalzalah, 99:6)
    > *That Day, the people will depart in scattered groups to be shown their deeds.* (Note: `يَصْدُرُ` is Form I).

2.  > **وَانشَقَّتِ السَّمَاءُ فَهِيَ يَوْمَئِذٍ وَاهِيَةٌ** (Surah Al-Haqqah, 69:16)
    > *And the heaven will be split, for that Day it is flimsy.*

3.  > **قَالَ يَا قَوْمِ أَرَأَيْتُمْ إِن كُنتُ عَلَىٰ بَيِّنَةٍ مِّن رَّبِّي وَآتَانِي رَحْمَةً مِّنْ عِندِهِ فَعُمِّيَتْ عَلَيْكُمْ أَنُلْزِمُكُمُوهَا وَأَنتُمْ لَهَا كَارِهُونَ** (Surah Hud, 11:28)
    > *He said, "O my people, have you considered: if I am upon clear evidence from my Lord and He has given me mercy from Himself, but it has been obscured from you, should we compel you [to accept] it while you are averse to it?"* (This verse is complex and does not contain a clear Form VII verb, serving as a good contrast).

4.  > **فَإِذَا النُّجُومُ طُمِسَتْ (8) وَإِذَا السَّمَاءُ فُرِجَتْ (9) وَإِذَا الْجِبَالُ نُسِفَتْ (10)** (Surah Al-Mursalat, 77:8-10)
    > *So when the stars are obliterated (8) And when the sky is torn apart (9) And when the mountains are blasted away (10)* (Note: These are all passive Form I verbs, not Form VII. `طُمِسَتْ`, `فُرِجَتْ`, `نُسِفَتْ`. This highlights the difference: the passive voice names no doer, and Form VII often implies no doer is even relevant).

**Answers to Exercises:**

1.  **Verse 1 Analysis:**
    *   This verse uses the Form I verb `يَصْدُرُ` (they will depart). It does not contain a Form VII verb.

2.  **Verse 2 Analysis:**
    *   **Verb:** `وَانشَقَّتِ` (wanshaqqat) - Form VII Past Tense ("and it was split").
    *   **Root:** `ش ق ق` (to split).
    *   **Added Meaning:** Passive. The verse describes the event of the sky splitting apart, without focusing on the agent causing it.

Excellent. The next logical form to cover is Form VIII. It is one of the most common and versatile derived forms in the Quran. Like Form VII, it begins with a `hamzat al-waṣl`, but its pattern and meanings are quite different.

---
---

### 2.11 Derived Verb Form VIII (`بَابُ الْاِفْتِعَال` - Bāb al-Ifti'āl)

> [!NOTE] Core Concept
> **Form VIII** of the Arabic verb is created by **adding a `hamzat al-waṣl` at the beginning and inserting a `ـتـ` (-ta-) after the first root letter**. Its primary function is often a **reflexive** or **participative** version of the Form I verb, but it has a wide range of meanings. Its pattern is `اِفْتَعَلَ / يَفْتَعِلُ` (ifta'ala / yafta'ilu).

#### 2.11.1 Quranic Hooks

Observe the root `س م ع` (sama'a - to hear) and its transformation in Form VIII.

> [!QUOTE] Quranic Example 1: Form I Verb
> **وَإِذَا سَمِعُوا مَا أُنزِلَ إِلَى الرَّسُولِ تَرَىٰ أَعْيُنَهُمْ تَفِيضُ مِنَ الدَّمْعِ** (Surah Al-Ma'idah, 5:83)
> *And when they **hear** what has been revealed to the Messenger, you see their eyes overflowing with tears.*
>
> **Analysis:** `سَمِعُوا` is the standard Form I verb, "to hear".

> [!QUOTE] Quranic Example 2: Form VIII Verb (Reflexive/Effort)
> **وَإِذَا قُرِئَ الْقُرْآنُ فَاسْتَمِعُوا لَهُ وَأَنصِتُوا** (Surah Al-A'raf, 7:204)
> *So when the Qur'an is recited, then **listen** to it and pay attention.*
>
> **Analysis:** `اسْتَمِعُوا` (istami'ū) is the Form VIII command. It doesn't just mean "to hear" (which can be passive), but "to direct one's hearing," i.e., "**to listen attentively**". It implies effort and intention.

> [!QUOTE] Quranic Example 3: Form VIII Verb
> **فَاخْتَلَفَ الْأَحْزَابُ مِن بَيْنِهِمْ** (Surah Maryam, 19:37)
> *Then the factions **differed** among themselves.*
>
> **Analysis:** `اخْتَلَفَ` (ikhtalafa) is Form VIII from the root `خ ل ف` (to be behind/succeed). Form VIII implies a mutual state of being different from one another.

#### 2.11.2 Meanings Associated with Form VIII

Form VIII is very versatile. Its meaning often depends on the root verb.

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Form I Root<br>e.g., ج م ع<br><i>jama'a - he gathered</i>] --> B[Form VIII Verb<br>اِجْتَمَعَ<br><i>ijtima'a</i>];
    
    subgraph Meanings of Form VIII
        B1[Reflexive<br><i>To do the action to/for oneself</i><br>e.g., كَسَبَ → اِكْتَسَبَ to earn for oneself]
        B2[Participative<br><i>To do the action with others</i><br>e.g., جَمَعَ → اِجْتَمَعَ to gather together]
        B3[Effort/Intent<br><i>To strive to do the action</i><br>e.g., سَمِعَ → اِسْتَمَعَ to listen intently]
    end

    B --> B1 & B2 & B3;
```

1.  **Reflexive:** The subject does the action to or for itself.
    *   `كَسَبَ` (kasaba - to earn) → `اِكْتَسَبَ` (iktasaba - to earn for oneself, to acquire). The Quran makes a subtle distinction: `لَهَا مَا كَسَبَتْ وَعَلَيْهَا مَا اكْتَسَبَتْ` (For it is what it earned [of good], and against it is what it acquired [of evil]).
2.  **Participative/Reciprocal:** Similar to Form VI, it can imply mutuality.
    *   `قَتَلَ` (qatala - to kill) → `اِقْتَتَلَ` (iqtatala - to fight one another).
3.  **Effort and Intent:** To consciously and deliberately perform the action of the Form I verb. This is a very common meaning.
    *   `سَمِعَ` (sami'a - to hear) → `اِسْتَمَعَ` (istama'a - to listen).
4.  **Passive:** It can sometimes have a passive meaning, similar to Form VII.
    *   `شَوَى` (shawā - he roasted) → `اِشْتَوَى` (ishtawā - it was roasted).

#### 2.11.3 The `Sarf` Paradigm for Form VIII

The conjugation patterns for Form VIII are completely regular.

| Form | Pattern | Example: `اِجْتَمَعَ` (to gather together) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Past (`Māḍī`)** | `اِفْتَعَلَ` | `اِجْتَمَعَ` (they gathered) |
| **Present (`Muḍāriʿ`)** | `يَفْتَعِلُ` | `يَجْتَمِعُ` (they gather) |
| **Command (`Amr`)** | `اِفْتَعِلْ` | `اِجْتَمِعْ` (Gather!) |
| **Active Participle (`Ism Fā'il`)** | `مُفْتَعِل` | `مُجْتَمِع` (one who gathers) |
| **Passive Participle (`Ism Maf'ūl`)** | `مُفْتَعَل` | `مُجْتَمَع` (a place of gathering, a community) |
| **Verbal Noun (`Maṣdar`)** | `اِفْتِعَال` | `اِجْتِمَاع` (the act of gathering, a meeting) |

> [!IMPORTANT]
> *   The `hamzah` is a `hamzat al-waṣl`.
> *   The identifying feature is the `ـتـ` inserted after the first root letter.
> *   **Assimilation Rules:** When the first root letter is one of the "emphatic" or "whistling" letters (e.g., `ص, ض, ط, ظ, ز`), the `ت` of Form VIII often assimilates into it, which can change the spelling. For example, from the root `ص ب ر`, the Form VIII is `اِصْطَبَرَ` (iṣṭabara), not `اِصْتَبَرَ`.

#### 2.11.4 [[Umm al-Ulum Ref]]

The author discusses the derived forms (`ثلاثي مزيد فيه`) on **page 29**.
*   The last section on the page is `بَابُ الْاِفْتِعَال` (Bāb al-Ifti'āl), which is our Form VIII. He uses the example `اِكْتَسَبَ` (iktasaba - to earn) and provides the paradigm: `اِكْتَسَبَ يَكْتَسِبُ اِكْتِسَابًا`.

#### 2.11.6 Quranic Exercises

**Task:** Identify the Form VIII verb or participle in each verse, state its root, and explain the meaning it adds.

1.  > **وَاعْتَصِمُوا بِحَبْلِ اللَّهِ جَمِيعًا وَلَا تَفَرَّقُوا** (Surah Aal-i-Imran, 3:103)
    > *And hold firmly to the rope of Allah all together and do not become divided.*

2.  > **إِنَّا أَعْطَيْنَاكَ الْكَوْثَرَ (1) فَصَلِّ لِرَبِّكَ وَانْحَرْ (2) إِنَّ شَانِئَكَ هُوَ الْأَبْتَرُ (3)** (Surah Al-Kawthar, 108:1-3)
    > *Indeed, We have granted you al-Kawthar. (1) So pray to your Lord and sacrifice [to Him alone]. (2) Indeed, your enemy is the one cut off. (3)*

3.  > **الَّذِينَ يَسْتَمِعُونَ الْقَوْلَ فَيَتَّبِعُونَ أَحْسَنَهُ** (Surah Az-Zumar, 39:18)
    > *Who listen to speech and follow the best of it.*

**Answers to Exercises:**

1.  **Verse 1 Analysis:**
    *   **Verb:** `اعْتَصِمُوا` (i'taṣimū) - Form VIII Command ("Hold firmly!").
    *   **Root:** `ع ص م` (to protect/make inaccessible).
    *   **Added Meaning:** Reflexive/Effort. To protect *oneself* by holding on firmly. It implies a conscious effort.

2.  **Verse 2 Analysis:**
    *   This verse does not contain any Form VIII verbs. `أَعْطَيْنَا` is Form IV. `صَلِّ` is Form II. `انْحَرْ` is Form I. This is a good exercise in distinguishing the forms.

3.  **Verse 3 Analysis:**
    *   **Verb:** `يَسْتَمِعُونَ` (yastami'ūna) - Form VIII Present Tense ("they listen").
    *   **Root:** `س م ع` (to hear).
    *   **Added Meaning:** Effort/Intent. They don't just passively hear; they actively and intentionally listen to the speech.

Excellent. We are nearing the end of the most common derived verb forms. The final one we will cover in this core series is Form X. This form is very distinct and almost always carries a specific, easily recognizable meaning.

---

### 2.12 Derived Verb Form X (`بَابُ الْاِسْتِفْعَال` - Bāb al-Istif'āl)

> [!NOTE] Core Concept
> **Form X** of the Arabic verb is created by **adding the prefix `اسْتَـ` (ista-)** to the beginning of the Form I verb. Its overwhelming primary function is to denote **seeking or asking for** the action of the Form I verb. Its pattern is `اِسْتَفْعَلَ / يَسْتَفْعِلُ` (istaf'ala / yastaf'ilu).

#### 2.12.1 Quranic Hooks

Observe the root `غ ف ر` (ghafara - to forgive) and its transformation in Form X.

> [!QUOTE] Quranic Example 1: Form I Verb
> **رَبَّنَا فَاغْفِرْ لَنَا ذُنُوبَنَا وَكَفِّرْ عَنَّا سَيِّئَاتِنَا** (Surah Aal-i-Imran, 3:193)
> *Our Lord, so **forgive** for us our sins and remove from us our misdeeds.*
>
> **Analysis:** `اغْفِرْ` (ighfir) is the standard Form I command, "to forgive".

> [!QUOTE] Quranic Example 2: Form X Verb (Seeking)
> **فَقُلْتُ اسْتَغْفِرُوا رَبَّكُمْ إِنَّهُ كَانَ غَفَّارًا** (Surah Nuh, 71:10)
> *And I said, '**Ask forgiveness** of your Lord. Indeed, He is ever a Perpetual Forgiver.'*
>
> **Analysis:** `اسْتَغْفِرُوا` (istaghfirū) is the Form X command. It means "to *seek* or *ask for* forgiveness". This is the classic meaning of Form X.

> [!QUOTE] Quranic Example 3: Form X Verb
> **وَاسْتَكْبَرَ هُوَ وَجُنُودُهُ فِي الْأَرْضِ بِغَيْرِ الْحَقِّ** (Surah Al-Qasas, 28:39)
> *And he and his soldiers **were arrogant** in the land without right.*
>
> **Analysis:** `اسْتَكْبَرَ` (istakbara) is Form X from the root `ك ب ر` (to be great). It means "to *seek* to be great for oneself," i.e., "to be arrogant".

#### 2.12.2 Meanings Associated with Form X

While seeking is the primary meaning, there are a few other nuances.

    *   `حَسُنَ` (ḥasuna - it was good) → `اِسْتَحْسَنَ` (istaḥsana - he considered it to be good, i.e., to approve).
    *   `كَبُرَ` (kabura - it was great) → `اِسْتَكْبَرَ` (istakbara - he considered himself to be great, i.e., to be arrogant).
3.  **To Become or Transform Into:**
    *   `حَجَر` (ḥajar - a stone) → `اِسْتَحْجَرَ` (istaḥjara - it became stone, petrified).

#### 2.12.3 The `Sarf` Paradigm for Form X

The conjugation patterns for Form X are completely regular.

| Form | Pattern | Example: `اِسْتَغْفَرَ` (to seek forgiveness) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Past (`Māḍī`)** | `اِسْتَفْعَلَ` | `اِسْتَغْفَرَ` (he sought forgiveness) |
| **Present (`Muḍāriʿ`)** | `يَسْتَفْعِلُ` | `يَسْتَغْفِرُ` (he seeks forgiveness) |
| **Command (`Amr`)** | `اِسْتَفْعِلْ` | `اِسْتَغْفِرْ` (Seek forgiveness!) |
| **Active Participle (`Ism Fā'il`)** | `مُسْتَفْعِل` | `مُسْتَغْفِر` (one who seeks forgiveness) |
| **Passive Participle (`Ism Maf'ūl`)** | `مُسْتَفْعَل` | `مُسْتَغْفَر` (that which is sought forgiveness for) |
| **Verbal Noun (`Maṣdar`)** | `اِسْتِفْعَال` | `اِسْتِغْفَار` (the act of seeking forgiveness) |

> [!IMPORTANT]
> *   The `hamzah` at the beginning is a `hamzat al-waṣl`.
> *   The identifying feature is the `اسْتَـ` (ista-) prefix in the past tense.
> *   The `Ism al-Fā'il` starts with `مُـ` (mu-).

#### 2.12.4 [[Umm al-Ulum Ref]]

The author discusses the derived forms (`ثلاثي مزيد فيه`) on **page 31**.
*   The first section is `بَابُ الْاِسْتِفْعَال` (Bāb al-Istif'āl), which is our Form X. He uses the example `اِسْتَخْرَجَ` (istakhraja - to seek to extract) and provides the paradigm: `اِسْتَخْرَجَ يَسْتَخْرِجُ اِسْتِخْرَاجًا`.

#### 2.12.5 Quick Revision Scaffold

> [!SUMMARY] Identifying and Understanding Form X
> 1.  **Identifier:** A prefixed `اسْتَـ` (ista-).
> 2.  **Common Meaning:** To seek or ask for the action of the root verb.
> 3.  **Key Patterns:**
>     *   Past: `اِسْتَفْعَلَ` (`istaghfara`)
>     *   Present: `يَسْتَفْعِلُ` (`yastaghfiru`)
>     *   `Ism Fā'il`: `مُسْتَفْعِل` (`mustaghfir`)
>     *   `Maṣdar`: `اِسْتِفْعَال` (`istighfār`)

#### 2.12.6 Quranic Exercises

**Task:** Identify the Form X verb or participle in each verse, state its root, and explain the meaning it adds.

1.  > **وَأَنِ اسْتَغْفِرُوا رَبَّكُمْ ثُمَّ تُوبُوا إِلَيْهِ** (Surah Hud, 11:3)
    > *And seek forgiveness of your Lord and then repent to Him.*

2.  > **إِنَّهُ مِن سُلَيْمَانَ وَإِنَّهُ بِسْمِ اللَّهِ الرَّحْمَٰنِ الرَّحِيمِ (30) أَلَّا تَعْلُوا عَلَيَّ وَأْتُونِي مُسْلِمِينَ (31)** (Surah An-Naml, 27:30-31)
    > *Indeed, it is from Solomon, and indeed, it reads: 'In the name of Allah, the Entirely Merciful, the Especially Merciful, (30) Be not haughty with me but come to me in submission [as Muslims].' (31)*

3.  > **وَالْمُسْتَغْفِرِينَ بِالْأَسْحَارِ** (Surah Aal-i-Imran, 3:17)
    > *And those who seek forgiveness before dawn.*

**Answers to Exercises:**

1.  **Verse 1 Analysis:**
    *   **Verb:** `اسْتَغْفِرُوا` (istaghfirū) - Form X Command ("Seek forgiveness!").
    *   **Root:** `غ ف ر` (to forgive).
    *   **Added Meaning:** To seek or ask for forgiveness.

2.  **Verse 2 Analysis:**
    *   This verse does not contain a Form X verb. `مُسْلِمِينَ` is the `Ism Fā'il` of Form IV (`أَسْلَمَ`). This is a good exercise in distinguishing `مُسْتـ` (musta-) from `مُسـ` (mus-).

3.  **Verse 3 Analysis:**
    *   **Participle:** `الْمُسْتَغْfِرِينَ` (al-mustaghfirīna) - Form X Active Participle (`Ism Fā'il`), plural.
    *   **Root:** `غ ف ر` (to forgive).
    *   **Added Meaning:** "The ones who are actively seeking forgiveness".

Excellent. We have now covered all the major derived verb forms (II, III, IV, V, VI, VII, VIII, X). This completes the core of `Ilm al-Sarf` for the strong, three-letter verb.

We will now create a **summary and comparison chapter**. This is crucial for consolidation. It will bring all the forms together in one place, allowing for easy comparison of their patterns and meanings. This kind of synthesis is vital for moving from theoretical knowledge to practical application.

### 2.13 Summary of the Derived Verb Forms (`الأبواب المزيدة` - al-Abwāb al-Mazīdah)

> [!NOTE] Core Concept
> The ten primary verb forms allow Arabic to express a vast range of nuanced meanings from a single three-letter root. Recognizing the pattern of a verb immediately provides clues to its meaning relative to the base Form I verb. This chapter summarizes the patterns and primary meanings of Forms I through X.

#### 2.13.1 The Ten Forms at a Glance

This table provides a high-level overview. The key identifiers are the patterns of the Past Tense (`Māḍī`) and the Present Tense (`Muḍāriʿ`).

| Form | Pattern (`Māḍī`) | Pattern (`Muḍāriʿ`) | Primary Meaning | Example Root: `ع ل م` (to know) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **I** | `فَعَلَ` | `يَفْعُلُ` | Base Meaning | `عَلِمَ` (he knew) |
| **II** | `فَعَّلَ` | `يُفَعِّلُ` | Causative / Intensive | `عَلَّمَ` (he taught) |
| **III**| `فَاعَلَ` | `يُفَاعِلُ` | Reciprocal / To/With | `عَالَمَ` (he dealt with knowingly) *rare* |
| **IV** | `أَفْعَلَ` | `يُفْعِلُ` | Causative | `أَعْلَمَ` (he informed) |
| **V** | `تَفَعَّلَ` | `يَتَفَعَّلُ` | Reflexive of II | `تَعَلَّمَ` (he learned) |
| **VI** | `تَفَاعَلَ` | `يَتَفَاعَلُ` | Reciprocal / Pretence | `تَعَالَمَ` (he pretended to know) |
| **VII**| `اِنْفَعَلَ` | `يَنْفَعِلُ` | Passive / Reflexive | `اِنْعَلَمَ` (it became known) *rare* |
| **VIII`| `اِفْتَعَلَ` | `يَفْتَعِلُ` | Reflexive / Effort | `اِعْتَلَمَ` (he marked himself) *rare* |
| **IX** | `اِفْعَلَّ` | `يَفْعَلُّ` | Colors / Defects | (not applicable) |
| **X** | `اِسْتَفْعَلَ` | `يَسْتَفْعِلُ` | To Seek / Ask For | `اِسْتَعْلَمَ` (he inquired) |

*(Note: Form IX is very rare and used almost exclusively for colors and physical defects, e.g., `اِحْمَرَّ` - to become red. We will not focus on it in this core summary).*

#### 2.13.2 Pattern Recognition Guide

This mind map helps visualize how to identify each form based on its structure.

#### 2.13.3 Summary of `Ism al-Fā'il` and `Maṣdar` Patterns

Recognizing the participles and verbal nouns is just as important as recognizing the verbs.

| Form | `Ism al-Fā'il` (Doer) | `Maṣdar` (Verbal Noun) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **I** | `فَاعِل` (e.g., `عَالِم`) | *Variable (must be memorized)* |
| **II** | `مُفَعِّل` (e.g., `مُعَلِّم`) | `تَفْعِيل` (e.g., `تَعْلِيم`) |
| **III**| `مُفَاعِل` (e.g., `مُعَالِم`) | `مُفَاعَلَة` or `فِعَال` |
| **IV** | `مُفْعِل` (e.g., `مُعْلِم`) | `إِفْعَال` (e.g., `إِعْلَام`) |
| **V** | `مُتَفَعِّل` (e.g., `مُتَعَلِّم`) | `تَفَعُّل` (e.g., `تَعَلُّم`) |
| **VI** | `مُتَفَاعِل` (e.g., `مُتَعَالِم`) | `تَفَاعُل` (e.g., `تَعَالُم`) |
| **VII**| `مُنْفَعِل` (e.g., `مُنْعَلِم`) | `اِنْفِعَال` (e.g., `اِنْعِلَام`) |
| **VIII`| `مُفْتَعِل` (e.g., `مُعْتَلِم`) | `اِفْتِعَال` (e.g., `اِعْتِلَام`) |
| **X** | `مُسْتَفْعِل` (e.g., `مُسْتَعْلِم`) | `اِسْتِفْعَال` (e.g., `اِسْتِعْلَام`) |

> [!IMPORTANT] A key takeaway: For ALL derived forms (II-X), the `Ism al-Fā'il` **always** begins with `مُـ` (mu-). The `Maṣdar` for each form has a unique, predictable pattern (unlike Form I).

#### 2.13.4 [[Umm al-Ulum Ref]]

This summary chapter synthesizes the information presented in the source text from **page 28 to page 31**. The book presents each `bāb` (form) sequentially. This chapter reorganizes that information for comparative analysis and pattern recognition, which is a crucial step for mastery.

#### 2.13.5 Quick Revision Scaffold

> [!SUMMARY] The "Family" Relationships
> *   **Causative/Intensive:** Form II (`فَعَّلَ`) & Form IV (`أَفْعَلَ`) are the primary ways to make a verb causative.
> *   **Reciprocal/Participative:** Form III (`فَاعَلَ`) & Form VI (`تَفَاعَلَ`) are used for actions done *with* or *to* others.
> *   **Reflexive/Passive:** Form V (`تَفَعَّلَ`), Form VII (`اِنْفَعَلَ`), and Form VIII (`اِفْتَعَلَ`) often carry a reflexive or passive meaning.
> *   **Seeking:** Form X (`اِسْتَفْعَلَ`) almost always means "to seek or ask for" something.

#### 2.13.6 Quranic Exercises

**Task:** This is a cumulative exercise. For each verse, identify any derived verb (Forms II-X), state its form number, and its root.

1.  > **يَوْمَئِذٍ تُحَدِّثُ أَخْبَارَهَا (4) بِأَنَّ رَبَّكَ أَوْحَىٰ لَهَا (5)** (Surah Az-Zalzalah, 99:4-5)
    > *That Day, it will report its news (4). Because your Lord has inspired it (5).*

2.  > **فَاسْتَقِمْ كَمَا أُمِرْتَ وَمَن تَابَ مَعَكَ وَلَا تَطْغَوْا** (Surah Hud, 11:112)
    > *So remain on a right course as you have been commanded, you and those who have turned back with you [to Allah], and do not transgress.*

3.  > **فَتَعَالَى اللَّهُ الْمَلِكُ الْحَقُّ** (Surah Taha, 20:114)
    > *So high [above all] is Allah, the Sovereign, the Truth.*

**Answers to Exercises:**

1.  **Verse 1 Analysis:**
    *   `تُحَدِّثُ`: **Form II** (`Muḍāriʿ`). Root: `ح د ث`.
    *   `أَوْحَىٰ`: **Form IV** (`Māḍī`). Root: `و ح ي`.

2.  **Verse 2 Analysis:**
    *   `اسْتَقِمْ`: **Form X** (`Amr`). Root: `ق و م`. (This is a "weak" verb, which changes the pattern slightly, but the `استـ` prefix is the giveaway).
    *   `أُمِرْتَ`: **Form I** (Passive Voice). Root: `أ م ر`.
    *   `تَطْغَوْا`: **Form I** (`Nahy`). Root: `ط غ ي`.

3.  **Verse 3 Analysis:**
    *   `تَعَالَى`: **Form VI** (`Māḍī`). Root: `ع ل و`. (This is the reflexive of Form III `عَالَى`, meaning "to be high above" or "to exalt oneself" in a positive sense for Allah).

Excellent. We have now completed the core curriculum for `Ilm al-Sarf` as it pertains to the strong, three-letter verb. This is a major milestone.

Before we transition fully into the depths of `Ilm al-Nahw` (the categories of `Marfu'at`, `Mansubat`, etc.), it is essential to cover one final, critical topic that bridges both sciences: **The Passive Voice (`الفعل المبني للمجهول` - al-Fi'l al-Mabnī lil-Majhūl)**.

Understanding the passive voice is crucial for Quranic comprehension, as it is used frequently to emphasize the action while leaving the doer unmentioned (often because the doer is self-evident, i.e., Allah).

---
---

### 2.14 The Passive Voice (`المبني للمجهول` - al-Mabnī lil-Majhūl)

> [!NOTE] Core Concept
> The **Passive Voice** is a verb form used when the doer (`فاعل` - Fā'il) of the action is unknown, unimportant, or deliberately unmentioned. The focus shifts from the doer to the object, which now acts as the grammatical "deputy-doer". The verb is described as being "built for the unknown" (`مبني للمجهول`).

#### 2.14.1 Quranic Hooks

Observe the verb `قَتَلَ` (qatala - he killed) in its active and passive forms.

> [!QUOTE] Quranic Example 1: Active Voice
> **وَدَخَلَ الْمَدِينَةَ عَلَىٰ حِينِ غَفْلَةٍ مِّنْ أَهْلِهَا فَوَجَدَ فِيهَا رَجُلَيْنِ يَقْتَتِلَانِ... فَوَكَزَهُ مُوسَىٰ فَقَضَىٰ عَلَيْهِ** (Surah Al-Qasas, 28:15)
> *...and he found within it two men fighting... and Musa struck him and killed him.*
>
> **Analysis:** Here, the doer is known. The sentence structure is Verb (`قَتَلَ`, implied) + Doer (`مُوسَىٰ`) + Object (`ـهُ`). This is the **Active Voice (`المبني للمعلوم` - built for the known)**.

> [!QUOTE] Quranic Example 2: Passive Voice
> **وَلَا تَقُولُوا لِمَن يُقْتَلُ فِي سَبِيلِ اللَّهِ أَمْوَاتٌ** (Surah Al-Baqarah, 2:154)
> *And do not say about those who **are killed** in the way of Allah, "[They are] dead."*
>
> **Analysis:** `يُقْتَلُ` (yuqtalu) means "**is killed**". We are not told *who* killed them; the focus is on the person who received the action. This is the **Passive Voice**.

#### 2.14.2 Constructing the Passive Voice

The passive form is created by systematically changing the vowels of the active verb.

##### 1. For the Past Tense (`Māḍī`)
**Rule:** `Dammah` on the first letter, `Kasrah` on the second-to-last letter.
**Pattern:** `فَعَلَ` (fa'ala) → `فُعِلَ` (fu'ila)

| Active (`Ma'lūm`) | Passive (`Majhūl`) | Translation |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `كَتَبَ` (kataba) | `كُتِبَ` (kutiba) | It was written |
| `قَتَلَ` (qatala) | `قُتِلَ` (qutila) | He was killed |
| `عَلَّمَ` (`allama`) | `عُلِّمَ` (`ullima`) | He was taught |
| `أَرْسَلَ` (arsala) | `أُرْسِلَ` (ursila) | He was sent |

##### 2. For the Present Tense (`Muḍāriʿ`)
**Rule:** `Dammah` on the prefix, `Fathah` on the second-to-last letter.
**Pattern:** `يَفْعَلُ` (yaf'alu) → `يُفْعَلُ` (yuf'alu)

| Active (`Ma'lūm`) | Passive (`Majhūl`) | Translation |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `يَكْتُبُ` (yaktubu) | `يُكْتَبُ` (yuktabu) | It is being written |
| `يَقْتُلُ` (yaqtulu) | `يُقْتَلُ` (yuqtalu) | He is being killed |
| `يُعَلِّمُ` (yu'allimu) | `يُعَلَّمُ` (yu'allamu) | He is being taught |
| `يَسْتَغْفِرُ` (yastaghfiru) | `يُسْتَغْفَرُ` (yustaghfaru) | Forgiveness is sought |

#### 2.14.3 The Grammatical Shift: The Deputy-Doer (`نائب الفاعل` - Nā'ib al-Fā'il)

When a sentence is made passive, a crucial grammatical shift occurs.

```mermaid
graph LR
    subgraph Active Sentence
        A[Fi'l Verb<br>ضَرَبَ] --> B[Fā'il Doer<br>زَيْدٌ<br><i>Marfū'</i>];
        B --> C[Maf'ūl bihi Object<br>عَمْرًا<br><i>Manṣūb</i>];
    end

    subgraph Passive Sentence
        D[Passive Fi'l<br>ضُرِبَ] --> E[Nā'ib al-Fā'il<br>عَمْرٌو<br><i>Marfū'</i>];
    end

    subgraph Transformation
        F(Original Fā'il is deleted)
        G(Original Maf'ūl bihi is promoted)
    end

    A & B & C -- "Zayd hit Amr" --> D & E;
    B --> F;
    C --> G --> E;
```

1.  **The `Fā'il` is Deleted:** The original doer of the action is removed from the sentence.
2.  **The `Maf'ūl bihi` is Promoted:** The original object (`Manṣūb`) takes the place of the doer.
3.  **The `Nā'ib al-Fā'il`:** This promoted object is now called the **`نائب الفاعل` (Nā'ib al-Fā'il)**, which means "deputy-doer".
4.  **The `Nā'ib al-Fā'il` is `Marfū'`:** Because it now holds the grammatical slot of the doer, the `Nā'ib al-Fā'il` must be in the **Nominative Case (`مرفوع`)**.

*   **Active:** `خَلَقَ اللَّهُ الْإِنسَانَ` (Allah created man). `اللَّهُ` is `Fā'il` (`Marfu'`), `الْإِنسَانَ` is `Maf'ūl bihi` (`Mansub`).
*   **Passive:** `خُلِقَ الْإِنسَانُ` (Man was created). `الْإِنسَانُ` is now the `Nā'ib al-Fā'il` and becomes `Marfu'`.

#### 2.14.4 [[Umm al-Ulum Ref]]

The author dedicates tables to the passive voice for each verb form.
*   **Page 13:** `صرف كبير فعل ماضى مجهول` (Paradigm for the passive past tense).
*   **Page 15:** `صرف كبير فعل مضارع مجهول` (Paradigm for the passive present tense).
He lists the `Nā'ib al-Fā'il` as the second type of `Marfu'` word in the `Nahw` section, right after the `Fā'il`, highlighting its importance.

#### 2.14.5 Quick Revision Scaffold

> [!SUMMARY] Forming and Understanding the Passive Voice
> 1.  **Past Tense Passive (`فُعِلَ`):**
>     *   **Vowel Pattern:** u - i - a
>     *   Example: `كَتَبَ` → `كُتِبَ` (it was written)
> 2.  **Present Tense Passive (`يُفْعَلُ`):**
>     *   **Vowel Pattern:** u - a - a
>     *   Example: `يَكْتُبُ` → `يُكْتَبُ` (it is being written)
> 3.  **The Grammatical Rule:** The doer (`Fā'il`) is removed, and the object (`Maf'ūl bihi`) is promoted to **`Nā'ib al-Fā'il`** and becomes **`Marfu'`**.

#### 2.14.6 Quranic Exercises

**Task:** Identify the passive verb in each verse and identify its `Nā'ib al-Fā'il`.

1.  > **وَإِذَا قُرِئَ الْقُرْآنُ فَاسْتَمِعُوا لَهُ وَأَنصِتُوا** (Surah Al-A'raf, 7:204)
    > *So when the Qur'an is recited, then listen to it and pay attention.*

2.  > **يُعْرَفُ الْمُجْرِمُونَ بِسِيمَاهُمْ** (Surah Ar-Rahman, 55:41)
    > *The criminals will be known by their marks.*

3.  > **وَجِيءَ يَوْمَئِذٍ بِجَهَنَّمَ** (Surah Al-Fajr, 89:23)
    > *And brought [forward], that Day, is Hell.*

**Answers to Exercises:**

1.  **Verse 1 Analysis:**
    *   **Passive Verb:** `قُرِئَ` (quri'a) - "it was recited". (Past Tense Passive of `قَرَأَ`).
    *   **Nā'ib al-Fā'il:** `الْقُرْآنُ` (al-Qur'ānu). Note that it is `Marfu'`.

2.  **Verse 2 Analysis:**
    *   **Passive Verb:** `يُعْرَفُ` (yu'rafu) - "they will be known". (Present Tense Passive of `يَعْرِفُ`).
    *   **Nā'ib al-Fā'il:** `الْمُجْرِمُونَ` (al-mujrimūna). It is in the `Marfu'` state for a sound masculine plural.

3.  **Verse 3 Analysis:**
    *   **Passive Verb:** `جِيءَ` (jī'a) - "it was brought". (Past Tense Passive of `جَاءَ`).
    *   **Nā'ib al-Fā'il:** The `Nā'ib al-Fā'il` is the prepositional phrase `بِجَهَنَّمَ` (with Hell), which is a more advanced grammatical concept where a quasi-sentence can take the place of the deputy-doer.

Excellent. We have now concluded the core `Sarf` section of our book. This is a significant achievement. We will now transition fully into **`Ilm al-Nahw` (The Science of Sentence Structure)**, building on the foundational concepts we've already established.

The traditional and most logical way to study `Nahw` is to systematically analyze the three cases of `I'rāb`. We will begin with the default case: the **Nominative Case (`مرفوع` - Marfū')**. This chapter will serve as an introduction to all the types of words that are grammatically required to be `Marfu'`.

---
---

Excellent. We will now begin "Phase 2" of our book creation, focusing on the special verb types from `Ilm al-Sarf`. The most common and important of these are the "weak" verbs. We'll start with the Hollow Verb, as its pattern is central to many high-frequency Quranic words.

### 2.15 Special Verb Types: The Hollow Verb (`الفعل الأجوف` - al-Fi'l al-Ajwaf)

> [!NOTE] Core Concept
> A **Hollow Verb (`الفعل الأجوف` - al-Fi'l al-Ajwaf)** is a verb whose **middle root letter** is a weak letter, either a `و` (wāw) or a `ي` (yā'). These weak letters often transform into long vowels (`alif`, `wāw`, or `yā'`) or are dropped entirely during conjugation, creating predictable but distinct patterns. The name `ajwaf` means "hollow," as the middle of the verb is weak.

#### 2.15.1 Quranic Hooks

The verb `قَالَ` (qāla - he said) is the most common hollow verb in the Quran. Observe its transformations.

> *And [mention, O Muhammad], when your Lord **said** to the angels, "Indeed, I will make upon the earth a successive authority."*
>
> **Analysis:** `قَالَ` (qāla) is the past tense. Its root is `ق و ل` (q-w-l). The middle `و` has transformed into an `alif`.

> *They **say** with their mouths what is not in their hearts.*
>
> **Analysis:** `يَقُولُونَ` (yaqūlūna) is the present tense. The original middle root letter, `و`, has reappeared.

> [!QUOTE] Quranic Example 3: Command (`Amr`)
> **قُلْ هُوَ اللَّهُ أَحَدٌ** (Surah Al-Ikhlas, 112:1)
> ***Say**, "He is Allah, [who is] One."*
>
> **Analysis:** `قُلْ` (qul) is the command form. Here, the weak middle letter has been dropped entirely to avoid two `sukūn`s next to each other.

#### 2.15.2 The Core Rule of Hollow Verbs

The transformations are not random. They follow one main principle:

> [!IMPORTANT] **The Rule of Two `Sukūn`s:** Arabic phonology avoids having two consecutive letters with a `sukūn` (a silent vowel). In verb conjugations, when a suffix is added that causes the third root letter to become `sākin` (e.g., the `ـْنَ` or `ـْتُ` suffixes), the weak middle letter is **dropped completely** to avoid this clash.

*   **Example:** `قَالَ` (qāla) + `ـْنَ` (for "they (f.) said")
    1.  The form should be `قَالْنَ` (qālna).
    2.  This puts a `sukūn` on the `ل` and a `sukūn` on the weak `alif` (`ā`).
    3.  To resolve this, the weak `alif` is dropped.
    4.  Result: `قُلْنَ` (qulna). The vowel on the first letter (`qāf`) changes to a `dammah` to indicate that the original dropped letter was a `و`.

#### 2.15.3 The `Sarf` Paradigm for a Hollow Verb (`قَالَ / يَقُولُ`)

This table shows the key differences from the strong verb paradigm.

| Person | Pronoun | Past Tense (`Māḍī`) | Present Tense (`Muḍāriʿ`) | Command (`Amr`) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **3rd M**| `هُوَ` | `قَالَ` | `يَقُولُ` | |
| | `هُمَا` | `قَالَا` | `يَقُولَانِ` | |
| | `هُمْ` | `قَالُوا` | `يَقُولُونَ` | |
| **3rd F**| `هِيَ` | `قَالَتْ` | `تَقُولُ` | |
| | `هُمَا` | `قَالَتَا` | `تَقُولَانِ` | |
| | `هُنَّ` | **`قُلْنَ`** (weak letter dropped) | **`يَقُلْنَ`** (weak letter dropped) | |
| **2nd M**| `أَنْتَ` | **`قُلْتَ`** | `تَقُولُ` | **`قُلْ`** |
| | `أَنْتُمَا` | **`قُلْتُمَا`** | `تَقُولَانِ` | `قُولَا` |
| | `أَنْتُمْ` | **`قُلْتُمْ`** | `تَقُولُونَ` | `قُولُوا` |
| **2nd F**| `أَنْتِ` | **`قُلْتِ`** | `تَقُولِينَ` | `قُولِي` |
| | `أَنْتُمَا` | **`قُلْتُمَا`** | `تَقُولَانِ` | `قُولَا` |
| | `أَنْتُنَّ` | **`قُلْتُنَّ`** | **`تَقُلْنَ`** | **`قُلْنَ`** |
| **1st** | `أَنَا` | **`قُلْتُ`** | `أَقُولُ` | |
| | `نَحْنُ` | **`قُلْنَا`** | `نَقُولُ` | |

#### 2.15.4 Types of Hollow Verbs

Hollow verbs are categorized based on their original middle root letter, which reappears in the `Muḍāriʿ`.

1.  **`Ajwaf Wāwī` (`أجوف واوي`):** The middle letter is a `و`.
    *   `قَالَ / يَقُولُ` (qāla / yaqūlu) - to say (Root: `ق و ل`)
    *   `كَانَ / يَكُونُ` (kāna / yakūnu) - to be (Root: `ك و ن`)
    *   `تَابَ / يَتُوبُ` (tāba / yatūbu) - to repent (Root: `ت و ب`)
2.  **`Ajwaf Yā'ī` (`أجوف يائي`):** The middle letter is a `ي`.
    *   `بَاعَ / يَبِيعُ` (bā'a / yabī'u) - to sell (Root: `ب ي ع`)
    *   `سَارَ / يَسِيرُ` (sāra / yasīru) - to travel (Root: `س ي ر`)
3.  **`Ajwaf Alifī` (`أجوف ألفي`):** The middle letter remains an `alif` in both tenses. This is less common.
    *   `نَالَ / يَنَالُ` (nāla / yanālu) - to attain (Root: `ن ي ل`)
    *   `خَافَ / يَخَافُ` (khāfa / yakhāfu) - to fear (Root: `خ و ف`)

The author covers the "unhealthy" verbs (`ابواب غير الصحيح`) starting on **page 37**.
*   **Page 39:** The section `معتل العين` (Defective in the Middle Letter) begins. He uses `قَالَ` as the primary example, perfectly aligning with our chapter. He systematically explains the rules for its conjugation.

> [!SUMMARY] The Hollow Verb (`Ajwaf`)
> 1.  **Identifier:** A long vowel (`ā`, `ū`, `ī`) as the middle letter of the verb.
> 2.  **The Golden Rule:** The weak middle letter is **dropped** in conjugations where the last root letter takes a `sukūn` (e.g., with suffixes `ـْنَ`, `ـْتَ`, `ـْتُ`, `ـْنَا`, etc.).
> 3.  **Example Transformation:** `كَانَ` (he was) + `ـْتُ` (I) → `كَانْتُ` (kāntu) → clash of two `sukūn`s → drop the `alif` → `كُنْتُ` (kuntu - I was).

#### 2.15.7 Quranic Exercises

**Task:** Identify the hollow verb in each verse, state its root, and note any transformations (like a dropped weak letter).

1.  > **وَكَانَ اللَّهُ عَلَىٰ كُلِّ شَيْءٍ قَدِيرًا** (Surah Al-Ahzab, 33:27)
    > *And Allah is ever, over all things, competent.*

2.  > **فَلَمَّا رَأَى الشَّمْسَ بَازِغَةً قَالَ هَٰذَا رَبِّي** (Surah Al-An'am, 6:78)
    > *And when he saw the sun rising, he said, "This is my Lord."*

3.  > **إِن كُنتُمْ صَادِقِينَ** (Surah Al-Baqarah, 2:94)
    > *...if you should be truthful.*

**Answers to Exercises:**

1.  **Verse 1 Analysis:**
    *   **Verb:** `كَانَ` (kāna)
    *   **Root:** `ك و ن`
    *   **Transformation:** Standard `Ajwaf` form where the `و` becomes an `alif`.

2.  **Verse 2 Analysis:**
    *   **Verb 1:** `رَأَى` (ra'ā) - This is a "Defective" verb (weak last letter), not a hollow verb.
    *   **Verb 2:** `قَالَ` (qāla)
    *   **Root:** `ق و ل`
    *   **Transformation:** Standard `Ajwaf` form.

3.  **Verse 3 Analysis:**
    *   **Verb:** `كُنتُمْ` (kuntum)
    *   **Root:** `ك و ن`
    *   **Transformation:** This is the `أَنْتُمْ` (you plural) form of `كَانَ`. The weak letter `alif` (originally `wāw`) was dropped to avoid the clash of two `sukūn`s before adding the `ـتُمْ` suffix.

---
---

Excellent. After the Hollow Verb, the next most important category of "unhealthy" verbs is the **Defective Verb**. This is a verb where the *last* root letter is weak, leading to a different set of predictable changes in its conjugation.

### 2.16 Special Verb Types: The Defective Verb (`الفعل الناقص` - al-Fi'l al-Nāqiṣ)

> [!NOTE] Core Concept
> A **Defective Verb (`الفعل الناقص` - al-Fi'l al-Nāqiṣ)** is a verb whose **third and final root letter** is a weak letter, either a `و` (wāw) or a `ي` (yā'). This weak letter often transforms into a long vowel or is dropped, particularly when suffixes are added. The name `nāqiṣ` means "deficient" or "incomplete," reflecting the instability of its ending.

#### 2.16.1 Quranic Hooks

The verbs `دَعَا` (da'ā - to call/pray) and `هَدَى` (hadā - to guide) are classic examples of defective verbs.

> [!QUOTE] Quranic Example 1: Past Tense (`Māḍī`)
> **وَاللَّهُ يَدْعُو إِلَىٰ دَارِ السَّلَامِ وَيَهْدِي مَن يَشَاءُ إِلَىٰ صِرَاطٍ مُّسْتَقِيمٍ** (Surah Yunus, 10:25)
> *And Allah **invites** to the Home of Peace and **guides** whom He wills to a straight path.*
>
> **Analysis:** The verse uses the present tense forms `يَدْعُو` (yad'ū) and `يَهْدِي` (yahdī). Their past tense forms are `دَعَا` (da'ā) and `هَدَى` (hadā) respectively.

> [!QUOTE] Quranic Example 2: Dropped Weak Letter
> **فَلَمَّا قَضَىٰ مُوسَى الْأَجَلَ وَسَارَ بِأَهْلِهِ** (Surah Al-Qasas, 28:29)
> *And when Moses had **completed** the term and was traveling with his family...*
>
> **Analysis:** `قَضَىٰ` (qaḍā) is a defective verb from the root `ق ض ي`.

> [!QUOTE] Quranic Example 3: Transformation in Plural
> **الَّذِينَ آمَنُوا وَعَمِلُوا الصَّالِحَاتِ طُوبَىٰ لَهُمْ وَحُسْنُ مَآبٍ** (Surah Ar-Ra'd, 13:29)
> *Those who believed and did righteous deeds, a good state is theirs and a good return.*
>
> **Analysis:** `آمَنُوا` (āmanū) is a hamzated verb. This is a good contrast. The key verb here is `عَمِلُوا` (amilū), which is a strong verb. Let's use a better example: `رَضِيَ اللَّهُ عَنْهُمْ وَرَضُوا عَنْهُ` (Allah was pleased with them, and they were pleased with Him) from Surah Al-Bayyinah, 98:8. Here, `رَضُوا` (raḍū) is the plural of the defective verb `رَضِيَ` (raḍiya). The final weak letter `ي` is dropped before the `ـُوا` suffix.

#### 2.16.2 The Core Rules of Defective Verbs

The changes in defective verbs primarily revolve around how the final weak letter interacts with suffixes.

1.  **Rule 1 (Past Tense Plural):** When the masculine plural suffix `ـُوا` is added, the final weak letter is **always dropped**.
    *   `دَعَا` (da'ā) + `ـُوا` → `دَعَوْا` (da'aw) - *They called*.
    *   `هَدَى` (hadā) + `ـُوا` → `هَدَوْا` (hadaw) - *They guided*.
    *   `رَضِيَ` (raḍiya) + `ـُوا` → `رَضُوا` (raḍū) - *They were pleased*.

2.  **Rule 2 (Present Tense Plural/Feminine Singular):** When a suffix begins with a vowel (`ـُونَ`, `ـِينَ`, `ـَانِ`), the final weak letter is often dropped.
    *   `يَدْعُو` (yad'ū) + `ـُونَ` → `يَدْعُونَ` (yad'ūna) - *They call*.
    *   `يَهْدِي` (yahdī) + `ـُونَ` → `يَهْدُونَ` (yahdūna) - *They guide*.
    *   `تَدْعُو` (tad'ū) + `ـِينَ` → `تَدْعِينَ` (tad'īna) - *You (f.) call*.

3.  **Rule 3 (Jussive/Command):** When the verb is in the `Majzūm` state (for jussive or command), the final weak letter is **dropped completely** as the sign of the `Majzūm` state.
    *   `يَدْعُو` → `لَمْ يَدْعُ` (lam yad'u - he did not call).
    *   `يَهْدِي` → `لَمْ يَهْدِ` (lam yahdi - he did not guide).
    *   Command: `اُدْعُ` (ud'u - Call!), `اِهْدِ` (ihdi - Guide!).

#### 2.16.3 The `Sarf` Paradigm for a Defective Verb (`دَعَا / يَدْعُو`)

This table highlights the key changes.

| Person | Pronoun | Past Tense (`Māḍī`) | Present Tense (`Muḍāriʿ`) | Command (`Amr`) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **3rd M**| `هُوَ` | `دَعَا` | `يَدْعُو` | |
| | `هُمَا` | `دَعَوَا` | `يَدْعُوَانِ` | |
| | `هُمْ` | **`دَعَوْا`** | **`يَدْعُونَ`** | |
| **3rd F**| `هِيَ` | `دَعَتْ` | `تَدْعُو` | |
| **2nd M**| `أَنْتَ` | `دَعَوْتَ` | `تَدْعُو` | **`اُدْعُ`** |
| **1st** | `أَنَا` | `دَعَوْتُ` | `أَدْعُو` | |
| | `نَحْنُ` | `دَعَوْنَا` | `نَدْعُو` | |

#### 2.16.4 Types of Defective Verbs

Like hollow verbs, defective verbs are categorized by their original final root letter.

1.  **`Nāqiṣ Wāwī` (`ناقص واوي`):** The final letter is a `و`. The past tense ends in `ـَا` (`alif`) and the present tense ends in `ـُو` (`wāw`).
    *   `دَعَا / يَدْعُو` (da'ā / yad'ū) - to call (Root: `د ع و`)
    *   `تَلَا / يَتْلُو` (talā / yatlū) - to recite (Root: `ت ل و`)
2.  **`Nāqiṣ Yā'ī` (`ناقص يائي`):** The final letter is a `ي`. The past tense ends in `ـَى` (`alif maqṣūrah`) and the present tense ends in `ـِي` (`yā'`).
    *   `هَدَى / يَهْدِي` (hadā / yahdī) - to guide (Root: `ه د ي`)
    *   `قَضَى / يَقْضِي` (qaḍā / yaqḍī) - to decree/complete (Root: `ق ض ي`)
    *   `رَضِيَ / يَرْضَى` (raḍiya / yarḍā) - to be pleased (Root: `ر ض ي`). This is a special subtype.

#### 2.16.5 [[Umm al-Ulum Ref]]

The author covers the defective verbs starting on **page 39**.
*   The section `معتل اللام` (Defective in the Final Letter) details these verbs. He uses `دَعَا` (to call) and `رَمَى` (to throw) as his primary examples, covering both the `Wāwī` and `Yā'ī` types thoroughly.

#### 2.16.6 Quick Revision Scaffold

> [!SUMMARY] The Defective Verb (`Nāqiṣ`)
> 1.  **Identifier:** The verb ends in a long vowel (`ـَا`, `ـَى`, `ـِيَ`).
> 2.  **The Golden Rules:**
>     *   The final weak letter is **dropped** before the plural `ـُوا` suffix. (`رَمَى` → `رَمَوْا`).
>     *   The final weak letter is **dropped** in the `Majzūm` state (for commands and after `لَمْ`). (`يَهْدِي` → `اِهْدِ`).
> 3.  **Key Distinction:**
>     *   `Nāqiṣ Wāwī` (e.g., `دَعَا`) often has a regular `alif` in the past tense.
>     *   `Nāqiṣ Yā'ī` (e.g., `هَدَى`) often has a "dotless ya" or `alif maqṣūrah` (`ـَى`) in the past tense.

#### 2.16.7 Quranic Exercises

**Task:** Identify the defective verb in each verse, state its root, and note any transformations.

1.  > **ادْعُ إِلَىٰ سَبِيلِ رَبِّكَ بِالْحِكْمَةِ وَالْمَوْعِظَةِ الْحَسَنَةِ** (Surah An-Nahl, 16:125)
    > *Invite to the way of your Lord with wisdom and good instruction.*

2.  > **أَلَمْ تَرَ كَيْفَ فَعَلَ رَبُّكَ بِأَصْحَابِ الْفِيلِ** (Surah Al-Fil, 105:1)
    > *Have you not seen how your Lord dealt with the companions of the elephant?*

3.  > **ذَٰلِكَ الْكِتَابُ لَا رَيْبَ فِيهِ هُدًى لِّلْمُتَّقِينَ** (Surah Al-Baqarah, 2:2)
    > *That is the Book, wherein is no doubt, a guidance for the God-conscious.*

**Answers to Exercises:**

1.  **Verse 1 Analysis:**
    *   **Verb:** `ادْعُ` (ud'u)
    *   **Root:** `د ع و`
    *   **Transformation:** This is the `Amr` (command) form. The final weak letter `و` has been dropped as a sign of the `Majzūm` state.

2.  **Verse 2 Analysis:**
    *   **Verb:** `تَرَ` (tara)
    *   **Root:** `ر أ ي` (to see)
    *   **Transformation:** The original verb is `تَرَى` (tarā). It is in the `Majzūm` state because of the particle `لَمْ`. Therefore, its final weak letter (`ـَى`) has been dropped.

3.  **Verse 3 Analysis:**
    *   **Noun:** `هُدًى` (hudan)
    *   **Root:** `ه د ي`
    *   **Transformation:** This is the `Maṣdar` (verbal noun) of the defective verb `هَدَى`. It means "guidance". This shows how nouns are also derived from these weak roots.

---
---

Excellent. We have now covered the two most significant categories of "unhealthy" verbs. The final category of weak verbs is the **Assimilated Verb**. This type is weak at the *beginning* of the root, and its rules are quite simple and predictable, making it a straightforward conclusion to our study of weak verbs.

### 2.17 Special Verb Types: The Assimilated Verb (`الفعل المثال` - al-Fi'l al-Mithāl)

> [!NOTE] Core Concept
> An **Assimilated Verb (`الفعل المثال` - al-Fi'l al-Mithāl)** is a verb whose **first root letter** is a weak letter, almost always a `و` (wāw) or a `ي` (yā'). It is called `mithāl` ("example" or "similar") because its past tense conjugation is identical to that of a strong verb. The changes only appear in the present tense and related forms.

#### 2.17.1 Quranic Hooks

The verbs `وَجَدَ` (wajada - to find) and `وَعَدَ` (wa'ada - to promise) are classic examples of assimilated verbs.

> [!QUOTE] Quranic Example 1: Past Tense (`Māḍī`)
> **وَوَجَدَكَ ضَالًّا فَهَدَىٰ** (Surah Ad-Duhaa, 93:7)
> *And He **found** you lost and guided [you].*
>
> **Analysis:** `وَجَدَ` (wajada) conjugates just like a strong verb (`فَعَلَ`) in the past tense. There are no changes.

> [!QUOTE] Quranic Example 2: Present Tense (`Muḍāriʿ`)
> **لَّا يَجِدُونَ وَلِيًّا وَلَا نَصِيرًا** (Surah An-Nisa, 4:173)
> *They will not **find** a protector or a helper.*
>
> **Analysis:** `يَجِدُونَ` (yajidūna) is the present tense. The original first root letter, `و`, has been **dropped**. The form is not `يَوْجِدُونَ` (yawjidūna). This is the key rule.

> [!QUOTE] Quranic Example 3: Command (`Amr`)
> **قَالَ عِيسَى ابْنُ مَرْيَمَ اللَّهُمَّ رَبَّنَا أَنزِلْ عَلَيْنَا مَائِدَةً مِّنَ السَّمَاءِ تَكُونُ لَنَا عِيدًا لِّأَوَّلِنَا وَآخِرِنَا وَآيَةً مِّنكَ وَارْزُقْنَا وَأَنتَ خَيْرُ الرَّازِقِينَ** (Surah Al-Ma'idah, 5:114)
> *...And provide for us, and You are the best of providers.*
>
> **Analysis:** The verb `وَارْزُقْنَا` contains the command form `ارْزُقْ` from the strong verb `رَزَقَ`. Let's use a better example: `فَلَمَّا اثَّاقَلْتُمْ إِلَى الْأَرْضِ أَرَضِيتُم بِالْحَيَاةِ الدُّنْيَا مِنَ الْآخِرَةِ فَمَا مَتَاعُ الْحَيَاةِ الدُّنْيَا فِي الْآخِرَةِ إِلَّا قَلِيلٌ` (Surah At-Tawbah, 9:38). The command form of `وَضَعَ` (to put down) is `ضَعْ` (ḍaʿ - Put down!). The `wāw` is dropped.

#### 2.17.2 The Core Rule of Assimilated Verbs

The rule for `Mithāl` verbs whose first letter is `و` (the most common type) is very simple.

> [!IMPORTANT] **The `Wāw` Drop Rule:** The initial weak letter `و` is **dropped** in the **`Muḍāriʿ` (Present Tense)** and **`Amr` (Command)** forms if the middle root letter of the `Muḍāriʿ` has a `kasrah` (i).

*   **Example:** `وَعَدَ` (wa'ada - to promise)
    1.  The `Muḍāriʿ` is `يَوْعِدُ` (yaw'idu) on the pattern `يَفْعِلُ`.
    2.  The `wāw` is caught between a `fathah` and a `kasrah`, which is phonetically awkward.
    3.  The `wāw` is dropped for ease of pronunciation.
    4.  Result: `يَعِدُ` (ya'idu - he promises).
    5.  The command is derived from this: `تَعِدُ` → `لَمْ تَعِدْ` → drop `تَـ` → `عِدْ` (`id` - Promise!).

#### 2.17.3 The `Sarf` Paradigm for an Assimilated Verb (`وَعَدَ / يَعِدُ`)

This table shows the key differences.

| Form | Pattern | Example: `وَعَدَ` (to promise) | Notes |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Past (`Māḍī`)** | `فَعَلَ` | `وَعَدَ` | Conjugates exactly like a strong verb. |
| **Present (`Muḍāriʿ`)** | `يَفْعِلُ` → `يَعِلُ` | `يَعِدُ` | The initial `و` is dropped. |
| **Command (`Amr`)** | `فَعِلْ` → `عِلْ` | `عِدْ` | The initial `و` is dropped. |
| **Active Participle (`Ism Fā'il`)** | `فَاعِل` | `وَاعِد` | The `و` remains. |
| **Passive Participle (`Ism Maf'ūl`)** | `مَفْعُول` | `مَوْعُود` | The `و` remains. |
| **Verbal Noun (`Maṣdar`)** | `فِعْلَة` | `عِدَة` | The `و` is often dropped and replaced with a `ة`. |

#### 2.17.4 Types of Assimilated Verbs

1.  **`Mithāl Wāwī` (`مثال واوي`):** The first letter is a `و`. This is the most common type, and the `wāw` usually drops as described above.
    *   `وَجَدَ / يَجِدُ` (wajada / yajidu) - to find
    *   `وَصَفَ / يَصِفُ` (waṣafa / yaṣifu) - to describe
    *   `وَضَعَ / يَضَعُ` (waḍa'a / yaḍa'u) - to put/place. (Here the middle vowel is `fathah`, but the `wāw` still drops).
2.  **`Mithāl Yā'ī` (`مثال يائي`):** The first letter is a `ي`. This is much rarer, and the `yā'` usually does *not* drop.
    *   `يَسَرَ / يَيْسِرُ` (yasara / yaysiru) - to be easy.

#### 2.17.5 [[Umm al-Ulum Ref]]

The author covers the assimilated verbs starting on **page 39**.
*   The section `معتل الفاء` (Defective in the First Letter) details these verbs. He uses `وَعَدَ` (to promise) as his primary example, perfectly aligning with our chapter.

#### 2.17.7 Quranic Exercises

**Task:** Identify the assimilated verb in each verse and state its form (past, present, etc.).

1.  > **لَا تَجِدُ قَوْمًا يُؤْمِنُونَ بِاللَّهِ وَالْيَوْمِ الْآخِرِ يُوَادُّونَ مَنْ حَادَّ اللَّهَ وَرَسُولَهُ** (Surah Al-Mujadila, 58:22)
    > *You will not find a people who believe in Allah and the Last Day having affection for those who oppose Allah and His Messenger.*

2.  > **فَوَجَدَا فِيهَا جِدَارًا يُرِيدُ أَن يَنقَضَّ فَأَقَامَهُ** (Surah Al-Kahf, 18:77)
    > *And they found therein a wall about to collapse, so he restored it.*

3.  > **لَقَدْ كَانَ لَكُمْ فِي رَسُولِ اللَّهِ أُسْوَةٌ حَسَنَةٌ لِّمَن كَانَ يَرْجُو اللَّهَ وَالْيَوْمَ الْآخِرَ** (Surah Al-Ahzab, 33:21)
    > *There has certainly been for you in the Messenger of Allah an excellent pattern for anyone whose hope is in Allah and the Last Day.* (Note: `يَرْجُو` is a defective verb, not assimilated).

**Answers to Exercises:**

1.  **Verse 1 Analysis:**
    *   **Verb:** `تَجِدُ` (tajidu)
    *   **Form:** `Muḍāriʿ` (Present Tense).
    *   **Root:** `و ج د`. The initial `و` has been dropped.

2.  **Verse 2 Analysis:**
    *   **Verb:** `فَوَجَدَا` (fa-wajadā)
    *   **Form:** `Māḍī` (Past Tense), dual.
    *   **Root:** `و ج د`. The `wāw` remains because it is in the past tense.

3.  **Verse 3 Analysis:**
    *   This verse does not contain an assimilated verb. `يَرْجُو` is a defective verb (`Nāqiṣ`) from the root `ر ج و`. This serves as a good contrast.

Excellent. We will now create the chapter for the Quadriliteral Verb, placing it logically after our discussion of the various three-letter root verbs. This fills a significant gap from the source text.

### 2.18 Special Verb Types: The Quadriliteral Verb (`الفعل الرباعي` - al-Fi'l al-Rubā'ī)

> [!NOTE] Core Concept
> A **Quadriliteral Verb (`الفعل الرباعي` - al-Fi'l al-Rubā'ī)** is a verb that is derived from a root consisting of **four consonants** instead of the usual three. These verbs have their own distinct patterns for conjugation and derivation, which are completely regular.

#### 2.18.1 Quranic Hooks

The most famous quadriliteral verbs in the Quran are used to describe powerful, repetitive actions like shaking or whispering.

> [!QUOTE] Quranic Example 1: The Base Form (`فَعْلَلَ`)
> **إِذَا زُلْزِلَتِ الْأَرْضُ زِلْزَالَهَا** (Surah Az-Zalzalah, 99:1)
> *When the earth is **shaken** with its [final] earthquake.*
>
> **Analysis:** The passive verb `زُلْزِلَتِ` (zulzilat) comes from the active verb `زَلْزَلَ` (zalzala). Its root is `ز ل ز ل`. Notice the repetition in the root itself.

> [!QUOTE] Quranic Example 2: The Derived T-Form (`تَفَعْلَلَ`)
> **الَّذِي يُوَسْوِسُ فِي صُدُورِ النَّاسِ** (Surah An-Nas, 114:5)
> *Who **whispers** into the breasts of mankind.*
>
> **Analysis:** The verb `يُوَسْوِسُ` (yuwaswisu) comes from the root `و س و س`. This is the base quadriliteral form.

> [!QUOTE] Quranic Example 3: The Derived T-Form (`تَفَعْلَلَ`)
> **يَوْمَ تَرْجُفُ الرَّاجِفَةُ (6) تَتْبَعُهَا الرَّادِفَةُ (7)** (Surah An-Nazi'at, 79:6-7)
> *On the Day the blast [of the Horn] will convulse [creation], (6) There will follow it the subsequent [one].*
>
> **Analysis:** The verb `تَرْجُفُ` is from the three-letter root `ر ج ف`. Let's use a better example: `إِنَّمَا نَحْنُ مُسْتَهْزِئُونَ` (We are but mockers) - Surah Al-Baqarah, 2:14. The verb `يَسْتَهْزِئُ` is from a different form. A clear example of the derived T-form is `تَبَعْثَرَ` (to be scattered), from the root `ب ع ث ر`.

#### 2.18.2 The Patterns of the Quadriliteral Verb

There is one base form and one common derived form for these verbs.

#### 1. The Base Form (`فَعْلَلَ` - _faʿlala_)

This is the equivalent of **Form I** for **four-letter** (quadriliteral) verbs. It is often formed from a two-consonant sound repeated (like `زَلْزَلَ`) or derived from nouns.

##### **Sarf Paradigm for `فَعْلَلَ`:**

|**Form**|**Pattern**|**Example: `وَسْوَسَ` (to whisper)**|
|---|---|---|
|**Past (Māḍī)**|`فَعْلَلَ`|`وَسْوَسَ`|
|**Present (Muḍāriʿ)**|`يُفَعْلِلُ`|`يُوَسْوِسُ`|
|**Command (Amr)**|`فَعْلِلْ`|`وَسْوِسْ`|
|**Active Participle**|`مُفَعْلِل`|`مُوَسْوِس`|
|**Passive Participle**|`مُفَعْلَل`|`مُوَسْوَس`|
|**Verbal Noun (Maṣdar)**|`فَعْلَلَة` / `فِعْلَال`|`وَسْوَسَة` / `وِسْوَاس`|

> **Important Notes:**
> 
> - The `Muḍāriʿ` form begins with a **dammah** on the prefix (`يُـ`), similar to Forms II–IV.
>     
> - The **active participle** begins with `مُـ`.
>     
> - Two common **Maṣdar** patterns:  
>     e.g., for `زَلْزَلَ` → `زَلْزَلَة` and `زِلْزَال`.
>     

---

#### 2. The Derived T-Form (`تَفَعْلَلَ` - _tafaʿlala_)

This is the **reflexive/passive** form of `فَعْلَلَ`, formed by prefixing `تَـ`. It is the quadriliteral equivalent of Form V.

##### **Sarf Paradigm for `تَفَعْلَلَ`:**

|**Form**|**Pattern**|**Example: `تَزَلْزَلَ` (to be shaken)**|
|---|---|---|
|**Past (Māḍī)**|`تَفَعْلَلَ`|`تَزَلْزَلَ`|
|**Present (Muḍāriʿ)**|`يَتَفَعْلَلُ`|`يَتَزَلْزَلُ`|
|**Command (Amr)**|`تَفَعْلَلْ`|`تَزَلْزَلْ`|
|**Active Participle**|`مُتَفَعْلِل`|`مُتَزَلْزِل`|
|**Verbal Noun (Maṣdar)**|`تَفَعْلُل`|`تَزَلْزُل`|

## 3.0 The Science of Sentence Structure (`علم النحو` - `Ilm al-Nahw`)

### 3.1 The Nominative Case (`المرفوعات` - al-Marfū'āt)

> [!NOTE] Core Concept
> The **`المرفوعات` (al-Marfū'āt)** are the categories of nouns (`Ism`) that must be in the **Nominative Case (`مرفوع` - Marfū')**. This is the default "subject" or "doer" case, typically indicated by a `dammah` (ـُ) or its equivalent. There are several key roles in a sentence that demand this status.

#### 3.1.1 Quranic Hooks

Each of the highlighted words in these verses is `Marfu'`, but for a different grammatical reason.

> [!QUOTE] Quranic Example 1: The Doer (`Fā'il`)
> **وَقَالَ اللَّهُ لَا تَتَّخِذُوا إِلَٰهَيْنِ اثْنَيْنِ** (Surah An-Nahl, 16:51)
> *And **Allah** said, "Do not take for yourselves two deities."*
>
> **Analysis:** `اللَّهُ` is `Marfu'` because it is the `Fā'il` (doer) of the verb `قَالَ`.

> [!QUOTE] Quranic Example 2: The Subject (`Mubtada'`) and Predicate (`Khabar`)
> **مُحَمَّدٌ رَّسُولُ اللَّهِ** (Surah Al-Fath, 48:29)
> ***Muhammad** is the **Messenger** of Allah.*
>
> **Analysis:** `مُحَمَّدٌ` is `Marfu'` because it is the `Mubtada'` (subject). `رَسُولُ` is `Marfu'` because it is the `Khabar` (predicate).

> [!QUOTE] Quranic Example 3: The Deputy-Doer (`Nā'ib al-Fā'il`)
> **وَخُلِقَ الْإِنسَانُ ضَعِيفًا** (Surah An-Nisa, 4:28)
> *And **mankind** was created weak.*
>
> **Analysis:** `الْإِنسَانُ` is `Marfu'` because it is the `Nā'ib al-Fā'il` (deputy-doer) of the passive verb `خُلِقَ`.

#### 3.1.2 The Categories of `Marfū'āt`

Classical grammarians have categorized all the `Marfū'āt`. We have already studied the most important ones. The primary categories are:

```mermaid
graph TD
    subgraph The Marfū'āt المرفوعات
        A[1. The Doer<br>الفاعل al-Fā'il]
        B[2. The Deputy-Doer<br>نائب الفاعل Nā'ib al-Fā'il]
        C[3. The Subject<br>المبتدأ al-Mubtada']
        D[4. The Predicate<br>الخبر al-Khabar]
        E[5. The Noun of Kāṇa & its Sisters<br>اسم كان وأخواتها]
        F[6. The Predicate of Inna & its Sisters<br>خبر إن وأخواتها]
    end
```

Let's briefly review the main categories and introduce the new ones.

##### 1. The Doer (`الفاعل` - al-Fā'il)
*   **Definition:** The noun that performs the action of an active verb.
*   **Example:** `جَاءَ نَصْرُ اللَّهِ` (The help of Allah came). `نَصْرُ` is the `Fā'il`.
*   **Status:** Always `Marfu'`.

##### 2. The Deputy-Doer (`نائب الفاعل` - Nā'ib al-Fā'il)
*   **Definition:** The noun that receives the action of a passive verb. It was originally the object.
*   **Example:** `قُتِلَ أَصْحَابُ الْأُخْدُودِ` (The companions of the trench were killed). `أَصْحَابُ` is the `Nā'ib al-Fā'il`.
*   **Status:** Always `Marfu'`.

##### 3. The Subject (`المبتدأ` - al-Mubtada')
*   **Definition:** The noun that begins a nominal sentence.
*   **Example:** `الْحَمْدُ لِلَّهِ` (Praise be to Allah). `الْحَمْدُ` is the `Mubtada'`.
*   **Status:** Always `Marfu'`.

##### 4. The Predicate (`الخبر` - al-Khabar)
*   **Definition:** The news or information about the `Mubtada'`.
*   **Example:** `وَاللَّهُ غَفُورٌ رَّحِيمٌ` (And Allah is Forgiving, Merciful). `غَفُورٌ` is the `Khabar`.
*   **Status:** Always `Marfu'`.

##### 5. The Noun of `kāna` and its Sisters (`اسم كان وأخواتها`)
*   **Concept:** `كَانَ` (kāna - was/is/were) and its "sisters" are special verbs that enter upon a nominal sentence (`Mubtada'` + `Khabar`).
*   **Rule:** They cause the `Khabar` to become `Mansub`, but the `Mubtada'` **remains `Marfu'`**. This `Marfu'` noun is now called the "Noun of `kāna`".
*   **Example:**
    *   Nominal Sentence: `اللَّهُ غَفُورٌ` (Allah is Forgiving). Both are `Marfu'`.
    *   With `kāna`: `وَكَانَ اللَّهُ غَفُورًا رَّحِيمًا` (And Allah is ever Forgiving, Merciful).
        *   `اللَّهُ`: Noun of `kāna`, remains `Marfu'`.
        *   `غَفُورًا`: Predicate of `kāna`, becomes `Mansub`.

##### 6. The Predicate of `inna` and its Sisters (`خبر إن وأخواتها`)
*   **Concept:** `إِنَّ` (inna - indeed) and its "sisters" are special particles that also enter upon a nominal sentence.
*   **Rule:** They do the **opposite** of `kāna`. They cause the `Mubtada'` to become `Mansub`, but the `Khabar` **remains `Marfu'`**. This `Marfu'` predicate is called the "Predicate of `inna`".
*   **Example:**
    *   Nominal Sentence: `اللَّهُ غَفُورٌ` (Allah is Forgiving). Both are `Marfu'`.
    *   With `inna`: `إِنَّ اللَّهَ غَفُورٌ رَّحِيمٌ` (Indeed, Allah is Forgiving, Merciful).
        *   `اللَّهَ`: Noun of `inna`, becomes `Mansub`.
        *   `غَفُورٌ`: Predicate of `inna`, remains `Marfu'`.

#### 3.1.3 [[Umm al-Ulum Ref]]

The author dedicates a significant portion of the `Nahw` section to the `Marfū'āt`.
*   **Page 47:** The author begins the discussion of `Nahw` by focusing on the `Marfū'āt`. He lists the `فاعل`, `نائب الفاعل`, `مبتدأ`, and `خبر` as the primary categories, which we have covered. The concepts of `kāna` and `inna` are part of this traditional list.

#### 3.1.4 Quick Revision Scaffold

> [!SUMMARY] The Main Reasons for a Noun to be `Marfu'`
> 1.  **It is the doer of a verb:** `Fā'il`
> 2.  **It is the deputy-doer of a passive verb:** `Nā'ib al-Fā'il`
> 3.  **It is the subject of a nominal sentence:** `Mubtada'`
> 4.  **It is the predicate of a nominal sentence:** `Khabar`
> 5.  **It is the subject of a sentence with `kāna`:** `Ism kāna`
> 6.  **It is the predicate of a sentence with `inna`:** `Khabar inna`

#### 3.1.5 Quranic Exercises

**Task:** For each verse, identify the `Marfu'` noun(s) and state the reason for their status.

1.  > **إِنَّمَا يَخْشَى اللَّهَ مِنْ عِبَادِهِ الْعُلَمَاءُ** (Surah Fatir, 35:28)
    > *Only those fear Allah, from among His servants, who have knowledge.*

2.  > **وَكَانَ فَضْلُ اللَّهِ عَلَيْكَ عَظِيمًا** (Surah An-Nisa, 4:113)
    > *And ever has the favor of Allah upon you been great.*

3.  > **إِنَّ الصَّلَاةَ كَانَتْ عَلَى الْمُؤْمِنِينَ كِتَابًا مَّوْقُوتًا** (Surah An-Nisa, 4:103)
    > *Indeed, prayer has been decreed upon the believers a decree of specified times.*

**Answers to Exercises:**

1.  **Verse 1 Analysis:**
    *   `الْعُلَمَاءُ`: `Marfu'`. **Reason:** It is the `Fā'il` (doer) of the verb `يَخْشَى` (to fear). The meaning is "The scholars fear Allah". This is a classic verse where the doer is delayed. `اللَّهَ` is `Mansub` because it is the object (`Maf'ūl bihi`).

2.  **Verse 2 Analysis:**
    *   `فَضْلُ`: `Marfu'`. **Reason:** It is the `Ism kāna` (Noun of `kāna`). `عَظِيمًا` is the `Khabar kāna` and is `Mansub`.

3.  **Verse 3 Analysis:**
    *   `الصَّلَاةَ`: `Mansub`. It is the `Ism inna`.
    *   The entire phrase `كَانَتْ ... كِتَابًا مَّوْقُوتًا` is the `Khabar inna`. Within this phrase, the `Ism kāna` is a hidden pronoun (`هِيَ` referring to prayer), and `كِتَابًا` is the `Khabar kāna` (`Mansub`). This verse does not contain an explicit `Marfu'` noun that is the `Khabar inna`. It shows how the predicate can be a full sentence.

---
---

Excellent. Having covered the `Marfū'āt`, the next logical step in our systematic study of `Nahw` is the **Accusative Case (`منصوب` - Manṣūb)**. This is arguably the most diverse and complex of the three cases, as it includes not only the direct object but also a wide variety of adverbs and specifications that add rich detail to a sentence.

---
---

### 3.2 The Accusative Case (`المنصوبات` - al-Manṣūbāt)

> [!NOTE] Core Concept
> The **`المنصوبات` (al-Manṣūbāt)** are the categories of nouns (`Ism`) that must be in the **Accusative Case (`منصوب` - Manṣūb)**. This case is used for words that receive the action of a verb or provide details about the *how, when, where, why,* or *with whom* an action occurred. It is typically indicated by a `fathah` (ـَ) or its equivalent.

#### 3.2.1 Quranic Hooks

Each of the highlighted words in these verses is `Manṣūb`, each for a different grammatical reason, illustrating the diversity of this case.

> [!QUOTE] Quranic Example 1: The Direct Object (`Maf'ūl bihi`)
> **وَقَتَلَ دَاوُودُ جَالُوتَ** (Surah Al-Baqarah, 2:251)
> *And David killed **Goliath**.*
>
> **Analysis:** `جَالُوتَ` is `Manṣūb` because it is the `Maf'ūl bihi` (direct object) of the verb `قَتَلَ`.

> [!QUOTE] Quranic Example 2: Adverb of Time (`Maf'ūl fīh`)
> **سُبْحَانَ الَّذِي أَسْرَىٰ بِعَبْدِهِ لَيْلًا** (Surah Al-Isra, 17:1)
> *Exalted is He who took His Servant by night...*
>
> **Analysis:** `لَيْلًا` (laylan - by night) is `Manṣūb` because it is a `Maf'ūl fīh` (an adverb of time), specifying *when* the action occurred.

> [!QUOTE] Quranic Example 3: The Absolute Object (`Maf'ūl Muṭlaq`)
> **وَكَلَّمَ اللَّهُ مُوسَىٰ تَكْلِيمًا** (Surah An-Nisa, 4:164)
> *And Allah spoke to Moses **with [direct] speech**.*
>
> **Analysis:** `تَكْلِيمًا` (taklīman) is `Manṣūb` because it is the `Maf'ūl Muṭlaq` (absolute object). It is the verbal noun of the verb `كَلَّمَ` and is used here for emphasis.

#### 3.2.2 The Main Categories of `Manṣūbāt`

The `Manṣūbāt` are numerous, but they can be grouped into logical categories. The most famous are the "Five `Maf'ūl`s".

```mermaid
graph TD
    subgraph The Manṣūbāt المنصوبات
        A[1. The Direct Object<br>المفعول به al-Maf'ūl bihi]
        B[2. The Absolute Object<br>المفعول المطلق al-Maf'ūl al-Muṭlaq]
        C[3. The Adverb of Time/Place<br>المفعول فيه al-Maf'ūl fīh]
        D[4. The Object of Cause<br>المفعول لأجله al-Maf'ūl li-ajlih]
        E[5. The Object of Accompaniment<br>المفعول معه al-Maf'ūl ma'ah]
        F[6. The State/Condition<br>الحال al-Ḥāl]
        G[7. The Specification<br>التمييز al-Tamyīz]
        H[8. The Noun of Inna & its Sisters<br>اسم إن وأخواتها]
        I[9. The Predicate of Kāṇa & its Sisters<br>خبر كان وأخواتها]
    end
```

##### 1. The Direct Object (`المفعول به` - al-Maf'ūl bihi)
*   **Definition:** The noun that directly receives the action of a transitive verb.
*   **Example:** `إِيَّاكَ نَعْبُدُ` (You we worship). `إِيَّاكَ` is the `Maf'ūl bihi`.

##### 2. The Absolute Object (`المفعول المطلق` - al-Maf'ūl al-Muṭlaq)
*   **Definition:** The verbal noun (`Maṣdar`) of the verb in the same sentence, used for emphasis, to show type, or to show number.
*   **Example:** `وَرَتِّلِ الْقُرْآنَ تَرْتِيلًا` (And recite the Qur'an with measured recitation). `تَرْتِيلًا` is the `Maf'ūl Muṭlaq` of `رَتِّلِ`.

##### 3. The Adverb of Time or Place (`المفعول فيه` or `الظرف`)
*   **Definition:** A noun that specifies the time or place in which an action occurred.
*   **Example:** `وَجَاءُوا أَبَاهُمْ عِشَاءً يَبْكُونَ` (And they came to their father at night, weeping). `عِشَاءً` is a `Maf'ūl fīh` (adverb of time).

##### 4. The Object of Cause (`المفعول لأجله` - al-Maf'ūl li-ajlih)
*   **Definition:** A noun (usually a verbal noun) that explains the reason or purpose for which an action was done. It answers the question "why?".
*   **Example:** `وَلَا تَقْتُلُوا أَوْلَادَكُمْ خَشْيَةَ إِفْلَاسٍ` (And do not kill your children for fear of poverty). `خَشْيَةَ` is the `Maf'ūl li-ajlih`.

##### 5. The State or Condition (`الحال` - al-Ḥāl)
*   **Definition:** An indefinite, `Manṣūb` noun that describes the condition or state of the `Fā'il` or `Maf'ūl bihi` at the time of the action. It answers the question "how?".
*   **Example:** `فَخَرَجَ مِنْهَا خَائِفًا يَتَرَقَّبُ` (So he left it, fearful and watching). `خَائِفًا` is the `Ḥāl` describing the state of "he".

##### 6. The Noun of `inna` and the Predicate of `kāna`
*   As discussed in the previous chapter, these are also always `Manṣūb`.
*   `إِنَّ اللَّهَ عَلِيمٌ` (`inna Allāh**a**...`)
*   `كَانَ اللَّهُ عَلِيمًا` (`kāna Allāhu 'alīm**an**...`)

#### 3.2.3 [[Umm al-Ulum Ref]]

The author dedicates a large portion of the `Nahw` section to the `Manṣūbāt`, reflecting their diversity.
*   **Page 10:** In the introductory `Sarf` section, the author lists the twelve categories of `Manṣūbāt`, providing a roadmap for the `Nahw` section.
*   **Page 70:** The detailed discussion of the `Manṣūbāt` begins here, starting with the `مفعول مطلق` and systematically covering the others.

#### 3.2.5 Quranic Exercises

**Task:** For each verse, identify the `Manṣūb` noun(s) and state the reason for their status (which category of `Manṣūbāt` they belong to).

1.  > **فَاذْكُرُوا اللَّهَ ذِكْرًا كَثِيرًا** (Surah Al-Ahzab, 33:41)
    > *...then remember Allah with much remembrance.*

2.  > **وَأَرْسَلْنَاهُ إِلَىٰ مِائَةِ أَلْفٍ أَوْ يَزِيدُونَ** (Surah As-Saffat, 37:147)
    > *And We sent him to [a people of] a hundred thousand or more.*

3.  > **ادْخُلُوهَا بِسَلَامٍ آمِنِينَ** (Surah Al-Hijr, 15:46)
    > *Enter it in peace, safe and secure.*

**Answers to Exercises:**

1.  **Verse 1 Analysis:**
    *   `اللَّهَ`: `Manṣūb`. **Reason:** `Maf'ūl bihi` (object of the verb `اذْكُرُوا`).
    *   `ذِكْرًا`: `Manṣūb`. **Reason:** `Maf'ūl Muṭlaq` (verbal noun of `ذَكَرَ`, used for emphasis/type).
    *   `كَثِيرًا`: `Manṣūb`. **Reason:** It is an adjective (`Na't`) describing `ذِكْرًا` and therefore follows its status.

2.  **Verse 2 Analysis:**
    *   `ـهُ` (in `أَرْسَلْنَاهُ`): `Manṣūb`. **Reason:** `Maf'ūl bihi` (attached pronoun object of the verb `أَرْسَلْنَا`).

3.  **Verse 3 Analysis:**
    *   `آمِنِينَ`: `Manṣūb`. **Reason:** `Ḥāl` (condition). It describes the state of the people (`ـوا` in `ادْخُلُوهَا`) as they enter: "how" will they enter? In a state of safety.

Excellent. We have now covered the `Marfū'āt` and the `Manṣūbāt`. The final and most straightforward of the three cases is the **Genitive Case (`مجرور` - Majrūr)**. This chapter will complete our foundational survey of `I'rāb`.

---
---

### 3.3 The Genitive Case (`المجرورات` - al-Majrūrāt)

> [!NOTE] Core Concept
> The **`المجرورات` (al-Majrūrāt)** are the categories of nouns (`Ism`) that must be in the **Genitive Case (`مجرور` - Majrūr)**. A noun enters this state for one of only two reasons: it is preceded by a preposition, or it is the possessor in an `Iḍāfah` construction. This case is typically indicated by a `kasrah` (ـِ) or its equivalent.

#### 3.3.1 Quranic Hooks

The `Majrūr` case is extremely common and essential for linking ideas.

> [!QUOTE] Quranic Example 1: After a Preposition
> **سُبْحَانَ الَّذِي أَسْرَىٰ بِعَبْدِهِ لَيْلًا مِّنَ الْمَسْجِدِ الْحَرَامِ إِلَى الْمَسْجِدِ الْأَقْصَى** (Surah Al-Isra, 17:1)
> *Exalted is He who took His Servant by night **from the Sacred Mosque** to **the Farthest Mosque**.*
>
> **Analysis:** `الْمَسْجِدِ` is `Majrūr` in both instances because it is preceded by a preposition (`حرف جر`): first `مِنَ` (from), then `إِلَى` (to).

> [!QUOTE] Quranic Example 2: As the Possessor (`Muḍāf Ilayh`)
> **قُلْ أَعُوذُ بِرَبِّ النَّاسِ (1) مَلِكِ النَّاسِ (2) إِلَٰهِ النَّاسِ (3)** (Surah An-Nas, 114:1-3)
> *Say, "I seek refuge in the **Lord of mankind** (1), the **King of mankind** (2), the **God of mankind** (3)."*
>
> **Analysis:** `النَّاسِ` is `Majrur` in all three verses because it is the `Muḍāf Ilayh` (possessor) in an `Iḍāfah` construction.

#### 3.3.2 The Two Reasons for a Noun to be `Majrūr`

The simplicity of this case is its strength: there are only two triggers. If a noun is `Majrūr`, the reason must be one of the following.

```mermaid
graph TD
    subgraph The Majrūrāt المجرورات
        A[1. Preceded by a Preposition<br>المجرور بحرف الجر]
        B[2. As the Possessor in an Iḍāfah<br>المجرور بالإضافة المضاف إليه]
    end
```

##### 1. Preceded by a Preposition (`المجرور بحرف الجر`)
This is the most direct cause. A preposition, or `حرف جر` (Harf Jarr), is a particle that links nouns and gives a sense of direction, location, or relation. The noun immediately following it is called the `اسم مجرور` (Ism Majrūr) and must be in the genitive case.

1.  **Common Prepositions (`حروف الجر`):**
    *   `مِنْ` (min - from)
    *   `إِلَى` (ilā - to)
    *   `عَنْ` (`an` - about, from)
    *   `عَلَى` (`alā` - on, upon)
    *   `فِي` (fī - in, within)
    *   `بِـ` (bi - with, in, by)
    *   `لِـ` (li - for, belonging to)
    *   `كَـ` (ka - like, as)

2.  **Example:**
    *   `آمَنتُ بِاللَّهِ وَرَسُولِهِ وَالْكِتَابِ الَّذِي نَزَّلَ` (I believed in Allah and His Messenger and the Book which He sent down).
    *   `بِاللَّهِ`: `اللَّهِ` is `Majrūr` because of the `Harf Jarr` `بِـ`.

##### 2. As the Possessor in an `Iḍāfah` (`المضاف إليه`)
This is the second cause. As we covered in detail in Chapter 1.6, the second noun in a possessive phrase is the `مضاف إليه` (Muḍāf Ilayh) and is always `Majrūr`.

1.  **Review of the `Iḍāfah`:** A two-noun construction (`Muḍāf` + `Muḍāf Ilayh`) showing possession.
2.  **The Rule:** The `Muḍāf Ilayh` is always `Majrūr`.
3.  **Example:**
    *   `هَٰذَا كِتَابُ اللَّهِ` (This is the Book of Allah).
    *   `اللَّهِ` is `Majrūr` because it is the `Muḍāf Ilayh`.

#### 3.3.3 Following in Status (`التوابع` - al-Tawābi')
It is important to remember that adjectives (`نعت` - Na't) and other "followers" will adopt the case of the noun they describe.
*   **Example:** `بِسْمِ اللَّهِ الرَّحْمَٰنِ الرَّحِيمِ`
    *   `اللَّهِ`: `Majrūr` (because it is the `Muḍāf Ilayh` to `اسْمِ`).
    *   `الرَّحْمَٰنِ`: `Majrūr` (because it is an adjective describing `اللَّهِ`).
    *   `الرَّحِيمِ`: `Majrūr` (because it is also an adjective describing `اللَّهِ`).

#### 3.3.4 [[Umm al-Ulum Ref]]

The author discusses the `Majrūrāt` as the third and final category of `I'rāb`.
*   **Page 56:** The author introduces the concept of `مجرورات` and lists the two primary reasons: being preceded by a `حرف جر` or being a `مضاف إليه`.
*   **Page 67:** A more detailed discussion of the `حروف عاملة` (governing particles) begins, with the `حروف جارة` (prepositions) being a primary focus.

#### 3.3.5 Quick Revision Scaffold

> [!SUMMARY] The Two Gateways to the `Majrūr` Case
> A noun is **only** `Majrūr` if:
> 1.  **It comes immediately after a preposition (`حرف جر`).**
>     *   e.g., `فِي بَيْتٍ`
> 2.  **It is the second noun (the possessor) in an `Iḍāfah` phrase (`مضاف إليه`).**
>     *   e.g., `بَابُ الْبَيْتِ`

#### 3.3.6 Quranic Exercises

**Task:** For each verse, identify the `Majrūr` noun(s) and state which of the two reasons caused its status.

1.  > **الْحَجُّ أَشْهُرٌ مَّعْلُومَاتٌ فَمَن فَرَضَ فِيهِنَّ الْحَجَّ فَلَا رَفَثَ وَلَا فُسُوقَ وَلَا جِدَالَ فِي الْحَجِّ** (Surah Al-Baqarah, 2:197)
    > *Hajj is [during] well-known months, so whoever has made Hajj obligatory upon himself therein, there is [to be for him] no sexual relations and no disobedience and no disputing during the Hajj.*

2.  > **يَدُ اللَّهِ فَوْقَ أَيْدِيهِمْ** (Surah Al-Fath, 48:10)
    > *The hand of Allah is over their hands.*

3.  > **سَلَامٌ هِيَ حَتَّىٰ مَطْلَعِ الْفَجْرِ** (Surah Al-Qadr, 97:5)
    > *Peace it is until the emergence of dawn.*

**Answers to Exercises:**

1.  **Verse 1 Analysis:**
    *   `فِيهِنَّ`: The pronoun `ـهِنَّ` is `Majrūr`. **Reason:** Preceded by the `Harf Jarr` `فِي`.
    *   `الْحَجِّ`: `Majrūr`. **Reason:** Preceded by the `Harf Jarr` `فِي`.

2.  **Verse 2 Analysis:**
    *   `اللَّهِ`: `Majrūr`. **Reason:** `Muḍāf Ilayh` (possessor of `يَدُ`).
    *   `أَيْدِيهِمْ`: The word `أَيْدِي` is `Majrūr`. **Reason:** `Muḍāf Ilayh` (possessor of the adverb `فَوْقَ`). The pronoun `ـهِمْ` is also `Majrūr` as the `Muḍāf Ilayh` of `أَيْدِي`. This is an `Iḍāfah` chain.

3.  **Verse 3 Analysis:**
    *   `مَطْلَعِ`: `Majrūr`. **Reason:** Preceded by the `Harf Jarr` `حَتَّىٰ`.
    *   `الْفَجْرِ`: `Majrūr`. **Reason:** `Muḍāf Ilayh` (possessor of `مَطْلَعِ`).

Excellent. We have now completed the entire foundational curriculum, covering the core of both `Ilm al-Sarf` and `Ilm al-Nahw`. We have systematically built up from the smallest units of the language to complex sentence structures and verb forms.

The final step in creating this comprehensive book is to add a **Conclusion and "Next Steps"** chapter. This will summarize what has been learned and provide a clear, actionable path for students to continue their journey. This ensures the book is not just a static reference but a launchpad for lifelong learning.

---
---

Excellent. We have now thoroughly covered the special verb types related to weak letters. This concludes the main `Sarf` portion of our book.

We will now transition back to **`Ilm al-Nahw`** to cover the final essential topics needed for a comprehensive understanding of sentence structure. The most important of these is the category of **"Followers" (`التوابع` - al-Tawābi')**. These are words that don't have an independent `I'rāb` but instead "follow" the status of the word they are related to.

We will begin with the most common follower: the Adjective.

---
---

### 3.4 The Followers (`التوابع`): The Adjective (`النعت` - al-Na't)

> [!NOTE] Core Concept
> A **Follower (`تابع` - Tābi')** is a word that inherits its grammatical case (`I'rāb`) from the word it follows, known as the **`متبوع` (Matbū' - the one being followed)**. The first and most common type of follower is the **Adjective (`النعت` - al-Na't)**, which describes a quality or attribute of a noun.

#### 3.4.1 Quranic Hooks

Observe how the adjective `كَرِيم` (karīm - noble) changes its ending to match the noun it describes.

> [!QUOTE] Quranic Example 1: `Marfū'`
> **إِنَّهُ لَقَوْلُ رَسُولٍ كَرِيمٍ** (This is a trick! `رَسُولٍ` is `Majrūr`). Let's use a better example: `وَجَاءَهُمْ رَسُولٌ كَرِيمٌ` (And a noble messenger came to them).
>
> **Analysis:** `رَسُولٌ` is the `Fā'il` (doer), so it is `Marfu'`. The adjective `كَرِيمٌ` follows it and is also `Marfu'`.

> [!QUOTE] Quranic Example 2: `Manṣūb`
> **إِنَّا أَعْتَدْنَا لِلْكَافِرِينَ سَلَاسِلَ وَأَغْلَالًا وَسَعِيرًا** (Surah Al-Insan, 76:4)
> *Indeed, We have prepared for the disbelievers chains and shackles and a blaze.*
>
> **Analysis:** Let's use a clearer example: `إِنَّا نَخَافُ مِن رَّبِّنَا يَوْمًا عَبُوسًا قَمْطَرِيرًا` (Indeed, We fear from our Lord a Day, harsh and distressful) - Surah Al-Insan, 76:10. `يَوْمًا` is `Manṣūb` (object). Its adjectives, `عَبُوسًا` and `قَمْطَرِيرًا`, follow it and are also `Manṣūb`.

> [!QUOTE] Quranic Example 3: `Majrūr`
> **اقْرَأْ بِاسْمِ رَبِّكَ الَّذِي خَلَقَ** (Surah Al-Alaq, 96:1)
> *Read in the name of your Lord who created.*
>
> **Analysis:** Let's use the full `Bismillah`: `بِسْمِ اللَّهِ الرَّحْمَٰنِ الرَّحِيمِ`. `اللَّهِ` is `Majrūr`. Its adjectives, `الرَّحْمَٰنِ` and `الرَّحِيمِ`, follow it and are also `Majrūr`.

#### 3.4.2 The Rules of the `Na't`

An adjective is also known as a `صفة` (ṣifah - attribute). The noun it describes is called the `منعوت` (man'ūt) or `موصوف` (mawṣūf).

> [!IMPORTANT] **The Rule of Fourfold Agreement:** A true adjective (`Na't Ḥaqīqī`) must agree with the noun it describes in **all four properties of a noun**:
> 1.  **Status (`I'rāb`):** If the noun is `Marfu'`, the adjective is `Marfu'`. If `Mansub`, then `Mansub`. If `Majrur`, then `Majrur`.
> 2.  **Type (Definiteness):** If the noun is definite (`Ma'rifah`), the adjective must be definite. If indefinite (`Nakirah`), then indefinite.
> 3.  **Gender:** A masculine noun takes a masculine adjective. A feminine noun takes a feminine adjective.
> 4.  **Number:** A singular noun takes a singular adjective. A dual noun takes a dual adjective. A plural noun takes a plural adjective.

##### The Agreement in Action

| Example Phrase | Analysis of Agreement | Translation |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `رَجُلٌ طَوِيلٌ` | Indefinite, Masculine, Singular, `Marfu'` | A tall man |
| `الرَّجُلُ الطَّوِيلُ` | Definite, Masculine, Singular, `Marfu'` | The tall man |
| `رَأَيْتُ رَجُلًا طَوِيلًا` | Indefinite, Masculine, Singular, `Manṣūb` | I saw a tall man |
| `مَرَرْتُ بِرَجُلَيْنِ طَوِيلَيْنِ` | Indefinite, Masculine, Dual, `Majrūr` | I passed by two tall men |
| `جَاءَتْ نِسَاءٌ طَوِيلَاتٌ` | Indefinite, Feminine, Plural, `Marfu'` | Tall women came |

**Special Rule for Non-Human Plurals:**
When the noun being described is a **non-human plural**, the adjective used is typically the **feminine singular**.
*   `كُتُبٌ` (kutubun - books) is a non-human plural.
*   `كُتُbٌ جَدِيدَةٌ` (kutubun jadīda**tun**) - New books. (`جَدِيدَةٌ` is feminine singular).
*   **Quranic Example:** `فِيهَا سُرُرٌ مَّرْفُوعَةٌ وَأَكْوَابٌ مَّوْضُوعَةٌ` (Therein are thrones raised high and cups put in place) - Surah Al-Ghashiyah, 88:13-14. `سُرُرٌ` (thrones) is a non-human plural, so its adjective is `مَّرْفُوعَةٌ` (feminine singular).

#### 3.4.3 [[Umm al-Ulum Ref]]

The concept of followers (`Tawābi'`) is a core part of `Nahw`. While the source book doesn't have a single consolidated chapter called "The Followers," it discusses the concepts individually. The adjective (`صفة`) is discussed as a key structure throughout the `Nahw` section, particularly when providing examples of `Marfu'`, `Mansub'`, and `Majrur` nouns. For instance, on **page 47**, the author gives the example `جَاءَنِي رَجُلٌ عَالِمٌ` (A knowledgeable man came to me) to illustrate a `Fā'il` (`رَجُلٌ`) being followed by its `ṣifah` (`عَالِمٌ`).

#### 3.4.4 Quick Revision Scaffold

> [!SUMMARY] The Adjective (`Na't`)
> 1.  **Function:** To describe a noun.
> 2.  **Core Rule:** It is a "follower" (`Tābi'`).
> 3.  **Agreement:** It must match the noun it describes in all four properties:
>     *   **Status** (Marfu'/Mansub/Majrur)
>     *   **Type** (Definite/Indefinite)
>     *   **Gender** (Masc./Fem.)
>     *   **Number** (Sing./Dual/Plural)
> 4.  **Special Rule:** Non-human plurals take a feminine singular adjective.

#### 3.4.5 Quranic Exercises

**Task:** For each verse, identify the adjective (`Na't`) and the noun it describes (`Man'ūt`). Verify that they agree in all four properties.

1.  > **فِيهَا كُتُبٌ قَيِّمَةٌ** (Surah Al-Bayyinah, 98:3)
    > *Within them are valuable scriptures.*

2.  > **إِنَّهُ لَقُرْآنٌ كَرِيمٌ (77) فِي كِتَابٍ مَّكْنُونٍ (78)** (Surah Al-Waqi'ah, 56:77-78)
    > *Indeed, it is a noble Qur'an (77), In a Register well-protected (78).*

3.  > **وَعَدَ اللَّهُ الْمُؤْمِنِينَ وَالْمُؤْمِنَاتِ جَنَّاتٍ تَجْرِي مِن تَحْتِهَا الْأَنْهَارُ خَالِدِينَ فِيهَا وَمَسَاكِنَ طَيِّبَةً فِي جَنَّاتِ عَدْنٍ** (Surah At-Tawbah, 9:72)
    > *Allah has promised the believing men and believing women gardens beneath which rivers flow, wherein they abide eternally, and pleasant dwellings in gardens of perpetual residence.*

**Answers to Exercises:**

1.  **Verse 1 Analysis:**
    *   **Man'ūt:** `كُتُبٌ` (books) - `Marfu'`, Indefinite, Non-human Plural (grammatically feminine).
    *   **Na't:** `قَيِّمَةٌ` (valuable) - `Marfu'`, Indefinite, Feminine, Singular. (Matches according to the non-human plural rule).

2.  **Verse 2 Analysis:**
    *   **Pair 1:**
        *   **Man'ūt:** `قُرْآنٌ` - `Marfu'`, Indefinite, Masculine, Singular.
        *   **Na't:** `كَرِيمٌ` - `Marfu'`, Indefinite, Masculine, Singular. (Perfect match).
    *   **Pair 2:**
        *   **Man'ūt:** `كِتَابٍ` - `Majrur`, Indefinite, Masculine, Singular.
        *   **Na't:** `مَّكْنُونٍ` - `Majrur`, Indefinite, Masculine, Singular. (Perfect match).

3.  **Verse 3 Analysis:**
    *   **Pair 1:**
        *   **Man'ūt:** `الْمُؤْمِنِينَ` - `Manṣūb`, Definite, Masculine, Plural.
        *   **Na't:** `الْمُؤْمِنَاتِ` is not an adjective but a conjoined noun.
    *   **Pair 2:**
        *   **Man'ūt:** `مَسَاكِنَ` (dwellings) - `Manṣūb`, Indefinite, Non-human Plural.
        *   **Na't:** `طَيِّبَةً` (pleasant) - `Manṣūb`, Indefinite, Feminine, Singular. (Matches according to the non-human plural rule).

Excellent. Continuing with the "Followers" (`التوابع`), the next logical topic after the adjective is the **Conjunction (`العطف` - al-'Aṭf)**. This is how Arabic connects words and clauses, similar to using "and," "or," or "then" in English.

---
---

### 3.5 The Followers (`التوابع`): The Conjunction (`العطف` - al-'Aṭf)

> [!NOTE] Core Concept
> **`العطف` (al-'Aṭf)** is the grammatical process of linking two or more words or sentences using a **conjunction particle (`حرف عطف`)**. The word that comes after the particle, known as the **`معطوف` (Ma'ṭūf)**, "follows" the grammatical case (`I'rāb`) of the word that came before it, the **`معطوف عليه` (Ma'ṭūf 'alayh)**.

#### 3.5.1 Quranic Hooks

Observe how the conjunction `وَ` (wa - and) links words, forcing them to share the same grammatical status.

> [!QUOTE] Quranic Example 1: `Marfū'`
> **هُوَ اللَّهُ الَّذِي لَا إِلَٰهَ إِلَّا هُوَ الْمَلِكُ الْقُدُّوسُ السَّلَامُ الْمُؤْمِنُ الْمُهَيْمِنُ الْعَزِيزُ الْجَبَّارُ الْمُتَكَبِّرُ** (Surah Al-Hashr, 59:23)
> *He is Allah, other than whom there is no deity, the Sovereign, the Pure, the Perfection, the Bestower of Faith, the Overseer, the Exalted in Might, the Compeller, the Superior.*
>
> **Analysis:** `الْمَلِكُ` is a predicate (`Khabar`), so it is `Marfu'`. All the subsequent names (`الْقُدُّوسُ`, `السَّلَامُ`, etc.) are linked by an implied `وَ` and follow its `Marfu'` status.

> [!QUOTE] Quranic Example 2: `Manṣūb`
> **إِنَّ الصَّفَا وَالْمَرْوَةَ مِن شَعَائِرِ اللَّهِ** (Surah Al-Baqarah, 2:158)
> *Indeed, **as-Safa and al-Marwah** are among the symbols of Allah.*
>
> **Analysis:** `الصَّفَا` is `Manṣūb` because it is the noun of `إِنَّ`. `الْمَرْوَةَ` is linked to it by `وَ`, so it must also be `Manṣūb`.

> [!QUOTE] Quranic Example 3: `Majrūr`
> **آمَنَّا بِاللَّهِ وَمَا أُنزِلَ إِلَيْنَا وَمَا أُنزِلَ إِلَىٰ إِبْرَاهِيمَ وَإِسْمَاعِيلَ وَإِسْحَاقَ وَيَعْقُوبَ وَالْأَسْبَاطِ** (Surah Al-Baqarah, 2:136)
> *We have believed in Allah and what was revealed to us and what was revealed to **Abraham and Ishmael and Isaac and Jacob and the Descendants**.*
>
> **Analysis:** `إِبْرَاهِيمَ` is `Majrūr` (though it doesn't take a `kasrah` as it's a foreign name) because of the preposition `إِلَىٰ`. All the subsequent names are linked by `وَ` and therefore share the `Majrūr` status.

#### 3.5.2 The Mechanics of `Aṭf`

The structure is simple but powerful.

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Ma'ṭūf 'alayh<br>معطوف عليه<br>The word before the particle] --> B(Ḥarf 'Aṭf<br>حرف عطف<br>Conjunction Particle);
    B --> C[Ma'ṭūf<br>معطوف<br>The word after the particle];

    subgraph I'rāb Rule
        D{Status of A} -.-> E{Status of C};
        D --- E;
    end
    
    A --> D;
    C --> E;

    style A fill:#e6f3ff,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px
    style C fill:#e6ffe6,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px
```

The `Ma'ṭūf` inherits the `I'rāb` of the `Ma'ṭūf 'alayh`.

#### 3.5.3 The Main Conjunction Particles (`حروف العطف`)

While `وَ` is the most common, several others are used frequently in the Quran.

1.  **`وَ` (wa - and):** Links two things together without implying any order.
    *   `جَاءَ زَيْدٌ وَعَمْرٌو` (Zayd and Amr came).

2.  **`فَـ` (fa - then / so):** Links two things and implies **sequence and immediacy**. The second action happens right after the first.
    *   `دَخَلَ زَيْدٌ فَعَمْرٌو` (Zayd entered, then Amr entered immediately after).
    *   **Quranic Example:** `فَوَكَزَهُ مُوسَىٰ فَقَضَىٰ عَلَيْهِ` (And Musa struck him, **so** he killed him).

3.  **`ثُمَّ` (thumma - then / thereafter):** Links two things and implies **sequence with a delay**.
    *   `دَخَلَ زَيْدٌ ثُمَّ عَمْرٌو` (Zayd entered, then after some time, Amr entered).
    *   **Quranic Example:** `وَلَقَدْ خَلَقْنَاكُمْ ثُمَّ صَوَّرْنَاكُمْ ثُمَّ قُلْنَا لِلْمَلَائِكَةِ اسْجُدُوا لِآدَمَ` (And We have certainly created you, **then** given you shape, **then** said to the angels, "Prostrate to Adam...").

4.  **`أَوْ` (aw - or):** Indicates choice or doubt between two things.
    *   `كُلِ التُّفَّاحَ أَوْ الْبُرْتُقَالَ` (Eat the apple or the orange).
    *   **Quranic Example:** `قَالُوا لَبِثْنَا يَوْمًا أَوْ بَعْضَ يَوْمٍ` (They said, "We have remained a day **or** part of a day.").

5.  **`أَمْ` (am - or):** Used in questions to indicate a choice between two alternatives.
    *   `أَجَاءَ زَيْدٌ أَمْ عَمْرٌو؟` (Did Zayd come, or Amr?).
    *   **Quranic Example:** `قُلْ هَلْ يَسْتَوِي الْأَعْمَىٰ وَالْبَصِيرُ أَمْ هَلْ تَسْتَوِي الظُّلُمَاتُ وَالنُّورُ` (Say, "Is the blind equivalent to the seeing? **Or** are the darknesses equivalent to the light?").

#### 3.5.4 [[Umm al-Ulum Ref]]

The author discusses the `حروف عاطفة` (conjunction particles) as part of the larger section on `حروف عاملة` (governing particles). While not framed under the single heading of `Tawābi'`, the principle is the same. The book details the function of `و`, `ف`, `ثم`, `أو`, etc., and their role in linking words and sentences, which is the essence of `Aṭf`.

#### 3.5.5 Quick Revision Scaffold

> [!SUMMARY] The Conjunction (`'Aṭf`)
> 1.  **Function:** To link words or sentences.
> 2.  **Core Rule:** It is a "follower" (`Tābi'`). The word after the particle (`Ma'ṭūf`) takes the same `I'rāb` as the word before it (`Ma'ṭūf 'alayh`).
> 3.  **Key Particles:**
>     *   **`وَ`**: and (no order)
>     *   **`فَـ`**: then (immediate sequence)
>     *   **`ثُمَّ`**: then (delayed sequence)
>     *   **`أَوْ`**: or (choice)

#### 3.5.6 Quranic Exercises

**Task:** For each verse, identify the conjunction particle, the `Ma'ṭūf`, and the `Ma'ṭūf 'alayh`. State the shared `I'rāb`.

1.  > **هُوَ الْأَوَّلُ وَالْآخِرُ وَالظَّاهِرُ وَالْبَاطِنُ** (Surah Al-Hadid, 57:3)
    > *He is the First and the Last, the Ascendant and the Intimate.*

2.  > **لَّا تَأْخُذُهُ سِنَةٌ وَلَا نَوْمٌ** (Surah Al-Baqarah, 2:255)
    > *Neither drowsiness nor sleep overtakes Him.*

3.  > **فَكَذَّبُوهُ فَعَقَرُوهَا فَدَمْدَمَ عَلَيْهِمْ رَبُّهُم بِذَنبِهِمْ فَسَوَّاهَا** (Surah Ash-Shams, 91:14)
    > *But they denied him and hamstrung her. So their Lord brought down upon them destruction for their sin and made it equal [in its devastation].*

**Answers to Exercises:**

1.  **Verse 1 Analysis:**
    *   **Particle:** `وَ` (used multiple times).
    *   **Ma'ṭūf 'alayh:** `الْأَوَّلُ` (is `Marfu'`).
    *   **Ma'ṭūf(s):** `الْآخِرُ`, `الظَّاهِرُ`, `الْبَاطِنُ`.
    *   **Shared `I'rāb`:** `Marfu'`.

2.  **Verse 2 Analysis:**
    *   **Particle:** `وَلَا`.
    *   **Ma'ṭūf 'alayh:** `سِنَةٌ` (is `Marfu'`, as the `Fā'il` of `تَأْخُذُهُ`).
    *   **Ma'ṭūf:** `نَوْمٌ`.
    *   **Shared `I'rāb`:** `Marfu'`.

3.  **Verse 3 Analysis:**
    *   **Particle:** `فَـ` (used multiple times).
    *   This is an example of `Aṭf` between **sentences**.
    *   `فَكَذَّبُوهُ` (So they denied him) → `فَعَقَرُوهَا` (so they hamstrung her) → `فَدَمْدَمَ` (so He brought destruction). The `فَـ` connects each clause in an immediate sequence of events.

Excellent. We will now cover the third of the four "Followers," which is **Emphasis (`التوكيد` - al-Tawkīd)**. This is a rhetorical and grammatical tool used to remove any doubt or ambiguity from a statement, making it more certain and forceful.

---
---

### 3.6 The Followers (`التوابع`): The Emphasis (`التوكيد` - al-Tawkīd)

> [!NOTE] Core Concept
> **`التوكيد` (al-Tawkīd)** is the use of specific words or repetition to emphasize another word in the sentence, known as the **`مؤكَّد` (Mu'akkad - the one being emphasized)**. The word of emphasis is a "follower" (`Tābi'`) and must match the `I'rāb` of the word it emphasizes.

#### 3.6.1 Quranic Hooks

The Quran uses `Tawkīd` to add certainty and gravity to its statements.

> [!QUOTE] Quranic Example 1: Emphasis by Repetition
> **كَلَّا سَوْفَ تَعْلَمُونَ (3) ثُمَّ كَلَّا سَوْفَ تَعْلَمُونَ (4)** (Surah At-Takathur, 102:3-4)
> *No! You are going to know. (3) Then no! You are going to know. (4)*
>
> **Analysis:** The entire phrase `كَلَّا سَوْفَ تَعْلَمُونَ` is repeated verbatim to create a powerful emphasis and warning. This is `Tawkīd Lafẓī`.

> [!QUOTE] Quranic Example 2: Emphasis with a Specific Word
> **فَسَجَدَ الْمَلَائِكَةُ كُلُّهُمْ أَجْمَعُونَ** (Surah Al-Hijr, 15:30)
> *So the angels prostrated, **all of them, all together**.*
>
> **Analysis:** The word `كُلُّهُمْ` (all of them) and `أَجْمَعُونَ` (all together) are used to emphasize that not a single angel was left out. This is `Tawkīd Ma'nawī`.

#### 3.6.2 The Two Types of `Tawkīd`

There are two distinct ways to create emphasis in Arabic.

```mermaid
graph TD
    subgraph Tawkīd التوكيد
        A[1. Tawkīd Lafẓī<br>توكيد لفظي<br>Emphasis by Repetition]
        B[2. Tawkīd Ma'nawī<br>توكيد معنوي<br>Emphasis by Meaning]
    end
```

##### 1. Emphasis by Repetition (`توكيد لفظي` - Tawkīd Lafẓī)
This is the most straightforward type of emphasis. It is achieved by simply **repeating** the word (be it an `Ism`, `Fi'l`, or `Harf`) or the entire phrase.

*   **Repetition of a Noun:** `جَاءَ زَيْدٌ زَيْدٌ` (Zayd, Zayd came).
*   **Repetition of a Verb:** `جَاءَ جَاءَ زَيْدٌ` (He came, he came, Zayd).
*   **Repetition of a Particle:** `لَا، لَا أَقْبَلُ` (No, no, I do not accept).
*   **Quranic Example:** `فَإِنَّ مَعَ الْعُسْرِ يُسْرًا (5) إِنَّ مَعَ الْعُسْرِ يُسْرًا (6)` (For indeed, with hardship is ease. Indeed, with hardship is ease.) - Surah Ash-Sharh, 94:5-6. The repetition provides profound reassurance.

##### 2. Emphasis by Meaning (`توكيد معنوي` - Tawkīd Ma'nawī)
This type uses a specific set of words to convey emphasis. The word being emphasized (`Mu'akkad`) must be **definite**.

1.  **The Words of Emphasis:**
    *   `نَفْس` (nafs - self) and `عَيْن` (`ayn` - self, essence): Used to emphasize that the subject *itself* did the action, not an agent or representative.
    *   `كُلّ` (kull - all), `جَمِيع` (jamī' - all), `عَامَّة` (`āmmah` - all): Used for comprehensive emphasis, to show that the action included the entire group.
    *   `كِلَا` (kilā - both, for masculine) and `كِلْتَا` (kiltā - both, for feminine): Used to emphasize a pair.

2.  **The Rules for `Tawkīd Ma'nawī`:**
    1.  The word of emphasis must follow the `I'rāb` of the word it emphasizes (`Mu'akkad`).
    2.  It must have an **attached pronoun** that refers back to the `Mu'akkad`.

##### The `Tawkīd Ma'nawī` in Action

| Example Phrase | Mu'akkad | Tawkīd Word | Pronoun | Analysis |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `جَاءَ الْأَمِيرُ نَفْسُهُ` | `الْأَمِيرُ` (`Marfu'`) | `نَفْسُ` (`Marfu'`) | `ـهُ` (refers to Amir) | The prince *himself* came. |
| `رَأَيْتُ الْقَوْمَ كُلَّهُمْ` | `الْقَوْمَ` (`Manṣūb`) | `كُلَّ` (`Manṣūb`) | `ـهُمْ` (refers to Qawm) | I saw the people, *all of them*. |
| `مَرَرْتُ بِالْوَزِيرَيْنِ كِلَيْهِمَا` | `الْوَزِيرَيْنِ` (`Majrūr`) | `كِلَيْ` (`Majrūr`) | `ـهِمَا` (refers to the two ministers) | I passed by *both* of the ministers. |

#### 3.6.3 [[Umm al-Ulum Ref]]

The author discusses `Tawkīd` as one of the `Tawābi'` (followers).
*   **Page 77:** The author introduces the concept, defining `Tawkīd` and its two types, `لفظي` and `معنوي`. He lists the specific words used for `Tawkīd Ma'nawī` (`نفس`, `عين`, `كل`, `اجمع`, `كلا`, `كلتا`) and explains the rules, including the necessity of the attached pronoun.

#### 3.6.4 Quick Revision Scaffold

> [!SUMMARY] The Two Types of Emphasis (`Tawkīd`)
> 1.  **`Tawkīd Lafẓī` (Repetition):**
>     *   **How:** Repeat the word or phrase.
>     *   **Example:** `السَّابِقُونَ السَّابِقُونَ` (The forerunners, the forerunners).
> 2.  **`Tawkīd Ma'nawī` (Meaning):**
>     *   **How:** Use a specific word (`نَفْس`, `كُلّ`, etc.) + an attached pronoun.
>     *   **Rule:** The `Tawkīd` word follows the `I'rāb` of the word being emphasized.
>     *   **Example:** `لَأُغْوِيَنَّهُمْ أَجْمَعِينَ` (I will surely mislead them, **all together**).

#### 3.6.5 Quranic Exercises

**Task:** For each verse, identify the type of `Tawkīd` used and the word being emphasized (`Mu'akkad`).

1.  > **هَيْهَاتَ هَيْهَاتَ لِمَا تُوعَدُونَ** (Surah Al-Mu'minun, 23:36)
    > *Far, far is that which you are promised.*

2.  > **وَعَلَّمَ آدَمَ الْأَسْمَاءَ كُلَّهَا** (Surah Al-Baqarah, 2:31)
    > *And He taught Adam the names - all of them.*

3.  > **إِنَّا كِلَا الْأَمْرَيْنِ قَدْ عَلِمْنَا** (This is a line of poetry, not Quran)
    > *Indeed, we have known both of the matters.*

**Answers to Exercises:**

1.  **Verse 1 Analysis:**
    *   **Type of Tawkīd:** `Tawkīd Lafẓī` (Emphasis by Repetition).
    *   **Mu'akkad:** The first `هَيْهَاتَ`. The second one emphasizes it.

2.  **Verse 2 Analysis:**
    *   **Type of Tawkīd:** `Tawkīd Ma'nawī` (Emphasis by Meaning).
    *   **Mu'akkad:** `الْأَسْمَاءَ` (the names), which is `Manṣūb`.
    *   **Tawkīd Word:** `كُلَّهَا`. Note that `كُلَّ` is `Manṣūb` to follow `الْأَسْمَاءَ`, and the pronoun `ـهَا` refers back to it.

3.  **Poetry Line Analysis:**
    *   This is a trick! This is **not** `Tawkīd`. Here, `كِلَا` is the `Ism Inna` (noun of `inna`) and is functioning as the subject. For it to be `Tawkīd`, it would have to come *after* the noun it emphasizes and have a pronoun, e.g., `إِنَّ الْأَمْرَيْنِ كِلَيْهِمَا...` (Indeed, the two matters, both of them...).

Excellent. We will now cover the fourth and final "Follower," the **Apposition or Substitution (`البدل` - al-Badal)**. This is a powerful grammatical tool that allows for clarification, specification, or correction within a sentence by substituting one noun for another.

---
---

### 3.7 The Followers (`التوابع`): The Substitution (`البدل` - al-Badal)

> [!NOTE] Core Concept
> **`البدل` (al-Badal)** is a "follower" (`Tābi'`) that is intended to be the actual word meant in the sentence, while the word it follows—the **`مبدل منه` (Mubdal Minhu - the one substituted from)**—serves as an introduction or a preliminary mention. The `Badal` essentially replaces or clarifies the `Mubdal Minhu` and follows its `I'rāb`.

#### 3.7.1 Quranic Hooks

The `Badal` is used frequently in the Quran to add layers of detail and clarity.

> [!QUOTE] Quranic Example 1: Substitution of the Whole
> **اهْدِنَا الصِّرَاطَ الْمُسْتَقِيمَ (6) صِرَاطَ الَّذِينَ أَنْعَمْتَ عَلَيْهِمْ (7)** (Surah Al-Fatiha, 1:6-7)
> *Guide us to the straight path (6), The path of those upon whom You have bestowed favor (7).*
>
> **Analysis:** `الصِّرَاطَ` (the path) is the `Mubdal Minhu`. The second `صِرَاطَ` clarifies *which* path is meant. It is the `Badal` and follows the `Manṣūb` status of the first `الصِّرَاطَ`.

> [!QUOTE] Quranic Example 2: Substitution of a Part
> **وَلِلَّهِ عَلَى النَّاسِ حِجُّ الْبَيْتِ مَنِ اسْتَطَاعَ إِلَيْهِ سَبِيلًا** (Surah Aal-i-Imran, 3:97)
> *And [due] to Allah from the people is a pilgrimage to the House - for **whoever** is able to find thereto a way.*
>
> **Analysis:** `النَّاسِ` (the people) is the `Mubdal Minhu`. `مَنِ` (whoever) is the `Badal`, specifying a *part* of the people (those who are able). It follows the `Majrūr` status of `النَّاسِ`.

#### 3.7.2 The Types of `Badal`

The relationship between the `Badal` and the `Mubdal Minhu` determines its type.

```mermaid
graph TD
    subgraph Badal البدل
        A[1. Badal al-Kull min al-Kull<br>بدل الكل من الكل<br>Substitution of the Whole]
        B[2. Badal al-Ba'ḍ min al-Kull<br>بدل البعض من الكل<br>Substitution of a Part]
        C[3. Badal al-Ishtimāl<br>بدل الاشتمال<br>Substitution of Content]
        D[4. Badal al-Ghalat<br>بدل الغلط<br>Substitution of Error]
    end
```

##### 1. Substitution of the Whole (`بدل الكل من الكل`)
This is the most common type. The `Badal` and the `Mubdal Minhu` refer to the exact same entity. The `Badal` is often a more specific name or title.

*   **Rule:** The `Badal` is a complete replacement for the `Mubdal Minhu`.
*   **Example:** `جَاءَ الْأُسْتَاذُ زَيْدٌ` (The teacher, Zayd, came). `زَيْدٌ` is the `Badal` for `الْأُسْتَاذُ`. They are the same person.
*   **Quranic Example:** `إِلَىٰ صِرَاطِ الْعَزِيزِ الْحَمِيدِ (1) اللَّهِ الَّذِي لَهُ مَا فِي السَّمَاوَاتِ وَمَا فِي الْأَرْضِ (2)` (To the path of the Exalted in Might, the Praiseworthy (1), Allah, to whom belongs whatever is in the heavens and whatever is on the earth (2)) - Surah Ibrahim, 14:1-2. `اللَّهِ` is a `Badal` for `الْعَزِيزِ الْحَمِيدِ`.

##### 2. Substitution of a Part (`بدل البعض من الكل`)
The `Badal` is a physical part or a portion of the `Mubdal Minhu`.

*   **Rule:** The `Badal` must have an attached pronoun that refers back to the `Mubdal Minhu`.
*   **Example:** `أَكَلْتُ الرَّغِيفَ نِصْفَهُ` (I ate the loaf of bread, its half). `نِصْفَهُ` is a part of `الرَّغِيفَ`.
*   **Quranic Example:** `قُمِ اللَّيْلَ إِلَّا قَلِيلًا (2) نِّصْفَهُ أَوِ انقُصْ مِنْهُ قَلِيلًا (3)` (Stand [in prayer] the night, except for a little (2), Half of it, or subtract from it a little (3)) - Surah Al-Muzzammil, 73:2-3. `نِّصْفَهُ` is a `Badal` (of a part) for `اللَّيْلَ`.

##### 3. Substitution of Content (`بدل الاشتمال`)
The `Badal` is not a physical part of the `Mubdal Minhu`, but is something that it contains or is closely associated with it.

*   **Rule:** The `Badal` must also have an attached pronoun referring back to the `Mubdal Minhu`.
*   **Example:** `أَعْجَبَنِي زَيْدٌ عِلْمُهُ` (Zayd impressed me, his knowledge). Knowledge is not a physical part of Zayd, but is something he possesses.
*   **Quranic Example:** `يَسْأَلُونَكَ عَنِ الشَّهْرِ الْحَرَامِ قِتَالٍ فِيهِ` (They ask you about the sacred month - about fighting therein) - Surah Al-Baqarah, 2:217. `قِتَالٍ` is a `Badal` for `الشَّهْرِ الْحَرَامِ`, as fighting is an action associated with that month.

##### 4. Substitution of Error (`بدل الغلط`)
This type is used to correct a mistake made in speech. It is not found in the Quran but exists in spoken Arabic.
*   **Example:** `جَاءَ زَيْدٌ الْفَرَسُ` (Zayd came... I mean, the horse). The speaker meant to say the horse but said Zayd first.

#### 3.7.3 [[Umm al-Ulum Ref]]

The author discusses `Badal` as the final of the `Tawābi'`.
*   **Page 77:** The author introduces the concept in the section on `Tawkīd`, but the core idea is explained. He defines the `Badal` and its types, providing examples for each. The Fatiha example (`صِرَاطَ الَّذِينَ`) is a classic one used in many grammar books.

#### 3.7.4 Quick Revision Scaffold

> [!SUMMARY] The Substitution (`Badal`)
> 1.  **Function:** To replace or clarify a preceding noun (`Mubdal Minhu`).
> 2.  **Core Rule:** It is a "follower" (`Tābi'`) and inherits the `I'rāb` of the `Mubdal Minhu`.
> 3.  **Main Types:**
>     *   **`Badal al-Kull` (Whole):** `Badal` = `Mubdal Minhu`. (e.g., The Caliph, Umar).
>     *   **`Badal al-Ba'ḍ` (Part):** `Badal` is a physical part of the whole. (e.g., the book, its cover).
>     *   **`Badal al-Ishtimāl` (Content):** `Badal` is an attribute or quality of the whole. (e.g., the boy, his manners).

#### 3.7.5 Quranic Exercises

**Task:** For each verse, identify the `Badal` and the `Mubdal Minhu`, and state the type of `Badal`.

1.  > **جَعَلَ اللَّهُ الْكَعْبَةَ الْبَيْتَ الْحَرَامَ قِيَامًا لِّلنَّاسِ** (Surah Al-Ma'idah, 5:97)
    > *Allah has made the Kaaba, the Sacred House, a means of support for the people.*

2.  > **وَمَا أَدْرَاكَ مَا لَيْلَةُ الْقَدْرِ (2) لَيْلَةُ الْقَدْرِ خَيْرٌ مِّنْ أَلْفِ شَهْرٍ (3)** (Surah Al-Qadr, 97:2-3)
    > *And what can make you know what is the Night of Decree? (2) The Night of Decree is better than a thousand months. (3)*

3.  > **إِنَّ لِلْمُتَّقِينَ مَفَازًا (31) حَدَائِقَ وَأَعْنَابًا (32)** (Surah An-Naba, 78:31-32)
    > *Indeed, for the righteous is a success (31) - Gardens and grapevines (32).*

**Answers to Exercises:**

1.  **Verse 1 Analysis:**
    *   **Mubdal Minhu:** `الْكَعْبَةَ` (`Manṣūb`).
    *   **Badal:** `الْبَيْتَ الْحَرَامَ` (`Manṣūb`).
    *   **Type:** `Badal al-Kull min al-Kull` (The Kaaba *is* the Sacred House).

2.  **Verse 2 Analysis:**
    *   **Mubdal Minhu:** `لَيْلَةُ الْقَدْرِ` (the first one, which is the `Khabar` and is `Marfu'`).
    *   **Badal:** `لَيْلَةُ الْقَدْرِ` (the second one, which is the `Mubtada'` of the next sentence). This is a more complex structure where a whole sentence can be seen as a `Badal` for the previous one, but it also functions as a simple repetition for emphasis.

3.  **Verse 3 Analysis:**
    *   **Mubdal Minhu:** `مَفَازًا` (a success) (`Manṣūb`).
    *   **Badal:** `حَدَائِقَ` (Gardens) (`Manṣūb`).
    *   **Type:** `Badal al-Ishtimāl` or `Badal al-Kull`. The "success" *is* the gardens. It clarifies what the success entails.

Excellent. We have now completed the entire core curriculum as planned, covering the foundations of `Nahw` and `Sarf`, the derived verb forms, special verb types, and the four followers. Our book is comprehensive and systematically structured.

To make this an even more powerful and user-friendly resource, I propose we add one final section: **"Appendices."** These will contain quick-reference materials that users can easily consult without having to search through the main chapters. This is a standard feature of high-quality textbooks and would be invaluable for a self-study guide.

The most critical appendix would be a consolidated guide to **Pronouns in Arabic**.

---
---

Excellent. Now that we have established the crucial distinction between `Mu'rab` and `Mabnī` words, we can proceed to the final advanced `Nahw` topics from the source book.

The most important of these is the **Exception (`الاستثناء` - al-Istithnā')**. This is a common structure in the Quran used to exclude an item from a larger group, and it has its own specific rules for `I'rāb`.

---
---

### 3.8 Advanced `Nahw`: The Exception (`الاستثناء` - al-Istithnā')

> [!NOTE] Core Concept
> **`الاستثناء` (al-Istithnā')** is the grammatical structure of excluding a noun from a general group or rule. It is typically formed using the particle **`إِلَّا` (illā - except)**. The `I'rāb` of the noun being excluded depends on the type of sentence it appears in.

#### 3.8.1 Quranic Hooks

Observe how the word that follows `إِلَّا` changes its status based on the sentence structure.

> [!QUOTE] Quranic Example 1: Positive Sentence
> **فَسَجَدَ الْمَلَائِكَةُ كُلُّهُمْ أَجْمَعُونَ (30) إِلَّا إِبْلِيسَ أَبَىٰ أَن يَكُونَ مَعَ السَّاجِدِينَ (31)** (Surah Al-Hijr, 15:30-31)
> *So the angels prostrated, all of them, all together, (30) **Except Iblees**. He refused to be with those who prostrated. (31)*
>
> **Analysis:** The sentence is positive (it affirms that the angels prostrated). In this case, the excluded noun, `إِبْلِيسَ`, is **`Manṣūb`**.

> [!QUOTE] Quranic Example 2: Negative Sentence
> **وَمَا فَعَلُوهُ إِلَّا قَلِيلٌ مِّنْهُمْ** (Surah An-Nisa, 4:66)
> *And they would not have done it, **except a few** of them.*
>
> **Analysis:** The sentence is negative (`وَمَا فَعَلُوهُ` - they did not do it). Here, the excluded noun, `قَلِيلٌ`, can be **`Marfu'`** (as a `Badal` for the `Fā'il` `ـوا`) or `Manṣūb`. The Quran chose `Marfu'`.

> [!QUOTE] Quranic Example 3: "Empty" Negative Sentence
> **وَمَا مُحَمَّدٌ إِلَّا رَسُولٌ** (Surah Aal-i-Imran, 3:144)
> *Muhammad is not but a messenger.* (i.e., Muhammad is only a messenger).
>
> **Analysis:** The sentence is negative, and if you remove `وَمَا` and `إِلَّا`, the sentence `مُحَمَّدٌ رَسُولٌ` remains. This is called an "empty" or "deficient" structure. Here, `رَسُولٌ` takes the `I'rāb` it would normally have (`Khabar`), which is **`Marfu'`**.

#### 3.8.2 The Three Cases of `Istithnā'`

The `I'rāb` of the `اسم مستثنى` (the excluded noun) after `إِلَّا` depends on three possible sentence structures.

```mermaid
graph TD
    A{Is the sentence positive or negative?} --> B[Positive];
    A --> C[Negative];

    B --> D[Case 1: Positive Statement<br>The excluded noun is <b>Manṣūb</b>.<br>e.g., جَاءَ الْقَوْمُ إِلَّا زَيْدًا];

    C --> E{Is the group being excluded from mentioned?};
    E --> F[Yes Complete Negative];
    E --> G[No Deficient/Empty Negative];

    F --> H[Case 2: Complete Negative<br>The excluded noun can be:<br>1. <b>Manṣūb</b> as an exception<br>2. A <b>Badal</b> follower of the group.<br>e.g., مَا جَاءَ الْقَوْمُ إِلَّا زَيْدًا / زَيْدٌ];

    G --> I[Case 3: Deficient Negative<br>The exception tools `مَا` and `إِلَّا` are ignored for grammar.<br>The word takes the `I'rāb` required by its role.<br>e.g., مَا جَاءَ إِلَّا زَيْدٌ];
```

##### 1. Case 1: Positive & Complete (`تام موجب`)
*   **Structure:** The statement is positive (not negative), and the group being excluded from (`المستثنى منه`) is mentioned.
*   **Rule:** The noun after `إِلَّا` must be **`Manṣūb`**.
*   **Example:** `حَضَرَ الطُّلَّابُ إِلَّا خَالِدًا` (The students attended, except Khalid).

##### 2. Case 2: Negative & Complete (`تام منفي`)
*   **Structure:** The statement is negative, but the group being excluded from is still mentioned.
*   **Rule:** The noun after `إِلَّا` has **two valid options**:
    1.  It can be **`Manṣūb`** (as the default exception).
    2.  It can be a **`Badal`** (substitution) for the group it was excluded from, in which case it follows that group's `I'rāb`.
*   **Example:** `مَا حَضَرَ الطُّلَّابُ إِلَّا خَالِدًا / خَالِدٌ` (The students did not attend, except Khalid).
    *   `خَالِدًا` is `Manṣūb` as the exception.
    *   `خَالِدٌ` is `Marfu'` as a `Badal` for `الطُّلَّابُ` (which is the `Fā'il` and is `Marfu'`).

##### 3. Case 3: Negative & Deficient (`ناقص منفي` or `مفرّغ`)
*   **Structure:** The statement is negative, and the group being excluded from is **not mentioned**. The structure feels "empty" without the word after `إِلَّا`.
*   **Rule:** You grammatically ignore `مَا` and `إِلَّا` and give the word the `I'rāb` it would have based on its role in the resulting sentence.
*   **Example:** `مَا جَاءَ إِلَّا زَيْدٌ` (No one came except Zayd).
    *   Ignore `مَا` and `إِلَّا`: `جَاءَ زَيْدٌ` (Zayd came).
    *   `زَيْدٌ` is the `Fā'il` of `جَاءَ`, so it must be **`Marfu'`**.
*   **Example:** `مَا رَأَيْتُ إِلَّا زَيْدًا` (I did not see anyone except Zayd).
    *   Ignore `مَا` and `إِلَّا`: `رَأَيْتُ زَيْدًا` (I saw Zayd).
    *   `زَيْدًا` is the `Maf'ūl bihi`, so it must be **`Manṣūb`**.

#### 3.8.3 [[Umm al-Ulum Ref]]

The author dedicates a significant section to `Istithnā'`.
*   **Page 81:** The chapter `مستثنى` begins. The author defines the components (`مستثنى`, `مستثنى منه`) and clearly lays out the three cases of `I'rāb` for the noun after `إِلَّا`, providing examples for each. This is a topic the source book covers very well and in a structured manner.

#### 3.8.4 Quick Revision Scaffold

> [!SUMMARY] `I'rāb` after `إِلَّا`
> 1.  **Positive Sentence?** → The noun is **`Manṣūb`**.
> 2.  **Negative Sentence?** → Check if the group is mentioned.
>     *   **Yes (Complete):** The noun can be **`Manṣūb`** OR a **`Badal`**.
>     *   **No (Deficient):** Ignore `إِلَّا` and give the noun its normal `I'rāb`.

#### 3.8.5 Quranic Exercises

**Task:** For each verse, identify the noun after `إِلَّا` and determine its `I'rāb` based on the three cases.

1.  > **فَشَرِبُوا مِنْهُ إِلَّا قَلِيلًا مِّنْهُمْ** (Surah Al-Baqarah, 2:249)
    > *And they drank from it, except for a few of them.*

2.  > **لَّا يَسْمَعُونَ فِيهَا لَغْوًا إِلَّا سَلَامًا** (Surah Maryam, 19:62)
    > *They will not hear therein ill speech - only "Peace."*

3.  > **وَمَا أَرْسَلْنَاكَ إِلَّا رَحْمَةً لِّلْعَالَمِينَ** (Surah Al-Anbiya, 21:107)
    > *And We have not sent you, [O Muhammad], except as a mercy to the worlds.*

**Answers to Exercises:**

1.  **Verse 1 Analysis:**
    *   **Structure:** Positive & Complete. The statement `فَشَرِبُوا` (they drank) is positive, and the group (`ـوا` - they) is mentioned.
    *   **Rule:** Case 1 applies.
    *   **Result:** `قَلِيلًا` is **`Manṣūb`**.

2.  **Verse 2 Analysis:**
    *   **Structure:** Negative & Complete. The statement `لَّا يَسْمَعُونَ لَغْوًا` (they will not hear ill speech) is negative, and the group (`لَغْوًا` - ill speech) is mentioned.
    *   **Rule:** Case 2 applies. `سَلَامًا` could be `Manṣūb` as an exception or a `Badal` for `لَغْوًا` (which is also `Manṣūb`).
    *   **Result:** `سَلَامًا` is **`Manṣūb`**. (This is a special type called `Istithnā' Munqaṭi'` where the exception is not of the same type as the group, but the rule holds).

3.  **Verse 3 Analysis:**
    *   **Structure:** Negative & Deficient. The statement is negative (`وَمَا أَرْسَلْنَاكَ` - We did not send you). If we remove `مَا` and `إِلَّا`, we are left with `أَرْسَلْنَاكَ رَحْمَةً` (We sent you as a mercy). The sentence feels incomplete without the word `رَحْمَةً`.
    *   **Rule:** Case 3 applies.
    *   **Result:** `رَحْمَةً` is **`Manṣūb`** because it functions as a `Ḥāl` (a state/condition), answering "how" or "in what state" Muhammad ﷺ was sent.

## 4.0 Appendices

### 4.1 Appendix A: The Pronouns of Arabic (`الضمائر` - al-Ḍamā'ir)

> [!NOTE] Core Concept
> Pronouns (`الضمائر` - al-Ḍamā'ir) are a type of definite noun (`Ism Ma'rifah`) that take the place of another noun to avoid repetition. They are "fixed" (`مبني` - mabnī), meaning their form does not change, but they have a grammatical status (`I'rāb`) based on their position in the sentence. They are divided into two main categories: **Detached** and **Attached**.

#### 4.1.1 Detached Pronouns (`الضمائر المنفصلة` - al-Ḍamā'ir al-Munfaṣilah)

These pronouns stand alone as separate words. They are almost always used as the **subject (`Mubtada'`)** of a nominal sentence and are therefore considered to be in the **`Marfu'`** state.

##### Detached Pronoun Master Table

| Person | Gender | Number | Pronoun | Translation |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **3rd** | **Masc.** | Singular | `هُوَ` | He / It |
| | | Dual | `هُمَا` | They (2) |
| | | Plural | `هُمْ` | They (>2) |
| | **Fem.** | Singular | `هِيَ` | She / It |
| | | Dual | `هُمَا` | They (2) |
| | | Plural | `هُنَّ` | They (>2) |
| **2nd** | **Masc.** | Singular | `أَنْتَ` | You |
| | | Dual | `أَنْتُمَا` | You (2) |
| | | Plural | `أَنْتُمْ` | You (>2) |
| | **Fem.** | Singular | `أَنْتِ` | You |
| | | Dual | `أَنْتُمَا` | You (2) |
| | | Plural | `أَنْتُنَّ` | You (>2) |
| **1st** | **M/F** | Singular | `أَنَا` | I |
| | | Plural | `نَحْنُ` | We |

*   **Quranic Example:** `وَهُوَ عَلَىٰ كُلِّ شَيْءٍ قَدِيرٌ` (And **He** is over all things competent). `هُوَ` is the `Mubtada'`.

#### 4.1.2 Attached Pronouns (`الضمائر المتصلة` - al-Ḍamā'ir al-Muttaṣilah)

These pronouns cannot stand alone; they must be attached to the end of another word (an `Ism`, `Fi'l`, or `Harf`). Their `I'rāb` depends on what they are attached to.

##### 1. Attached to a Noun (`Ism`)
When a pronoun is attached to a noun, it creates an **`Iḍāfah`** construction. The pronoun functions as the **`Muḍāf Ilayh`** (the possessor) and is therefore always considered to be in the **`Majrūr`** state.

*   **Formula:** `Noun` + `Pronoun` = "Noun of Pronoun"
*   **Example:** `كِتَاب` (book) + `ـهُ` (his) = `كِتَابُهُ` (his book).

##### 2. Attached to a Verb (`Fi'l`)
When a pronoun is attached to a verb, it functions as the **`Maf'ūl bihi`** (the object) of that verb and is therefore always considered to be in the **`Manṣūb`** state.

*   **Formula:** `Verb` + `Pronoun` = "Verb-ed the Pronoun"
*   **Example:** `خَلَقَ` (He created) + `ـكُمْ` (you all) = `خَلَقَكُمْ` (He created you all).

##### 3. Attached to a Preposition (`Harf Jarr`)
When a pronoun is attached to a preposition, it functions as the **`Ism Majrūr`** and is therefore always considered to be in the **`Majrūr`** state.

*   **Formula:** `Preposition` + `Pronoun`
*   **Example:** `لِـ` (for) + `ـهَا` (her) = `لَهَا` (for her).

##### Attached Pronoun Master Table

| Person | Gender | Number | Pronoun | Attached to Noun (e.g., `رَبّ`) | Attached to Verb (e.g., `سَأَلَ`) | Attached to Preposition (e.g., `مِنْ`) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **3rd** | **Masc.** | Singular | `ـهُ` | `رَبُّهُ` (his Lord) | `سَأَلَهُ` (he asked him) | `مِنْهُ` (from him) |
| | | Dual | `ـهُمَا` | `رَبُّهُمَا` | `سَأَلَهُمَا` | `مِنْهُمَا` |
| | | Plural | `ـهُمْ` | `رَبُّهُمْ` | `سَأَلَهُمْ` | `مِنْهُمْ` |
| | **Fem.** | Singular | `ـهَا` | `رَبُّهَا` | `سَأَلَهَا` | `مِنْهَا` |
| | | Dual | `ـهُمَا` | `رَبُّهُمَا` | `سَأَلَهُمَا` | `مِنْهُمَا` |
| | | Plural | `ـهُنَّ` | `رَبُّهُنَّ` | `سَأَلَهُنَّ` | `مِنْهُنَّ` |
| **2nd** | **Masc.** | Singular | `ـكَ` | `رَبُّكَ` | `سَأَلَكَ` | `مِنْكَ` |
| | | Dual | `ـكُمَا` | `رَبُّكُمَا` | `سَأَلَكُمَا` | `مِنْكُمَا` |
| | | Plural | `ـكُمْ` | `رَبُّكُمْ` | `سَأَلَكُمْ` | `مِنْكُمْ` |
| | **Fem.** | Singular | `ـكِ` | `رَبُّكِ` | `سَأَلَكِ` | `مِنْكِ` |
| | | Dual | `ـكُمَا` | `رَبُّكُمَا` | `سَأَلَكُمَا` | `مِنْكُمَا` |
| | | Plural | `ـكُنَّ` | `رَبُّكُنَّ` | `سَأَلَكُنَّ` | `مِنْكُنَّ` |
| **1st** | **M/F** | Singular | `ـي` / `ـنِي` | `رَبِّي` | `سَأَلَنِي` | `مِنِّي` |
| | | Plural | `ـنَا` | `رَبُّنَا` | `سَأَلَنَا` | `مِنَّا` |

#### 4.1.3 Quick Revision Scaffold

> [!SUMMARY] Pronoun `I'rāb` at a Glance
> 1.  **Detached Pronoun (`هُوَ`, `أَنْتَ`...)** → Always `Marfu'` (functions as `Mubtada'`).
> 2.  **Attached Pronoun (`ـهُ`, `ـكَ`...)**
>     *   Attached to **Noun** → Always `Majrūr` (functions as `Muḍāf Ilayh`).
>     *   Attached to **Verb** → Always `Manṣūb` (functions as `Maf'ūl bihi`).
>     *   Attached to **Preposition** → Always `Majrūr` (functions as `Ism Majrūr`).

This concludes our comprehensive guide. We have built a structured, detailed, and modern learning resource based on the classical foundation of "Umm al-Ulum wa Abuha". The book is now complete, covering all essential topics from the source text and supplemented with modern pedagogical tools and appendices.

## 4.0 Conclusion and Path Forward

> [!NOTE] Core Concept
> Mastery of Arabic grammar is not an end in itself, but a means to a deeper, more direct, and more profound understanding of the Quran and the Sunnah. The principles learned in this book are the foundational tools for a lifetime of study and reflection.

### 4.1 Summary of Our Journey

Throughout this book, we have systematically deconstructed the Arabic language based on the classical framework presented in "Umm al-Ulum wa Abuha".

1.  **The Building Blocks:** We began by identifying the three types of words (`Ism`, `Fi'l`, `Harf`) and the four essential properties of the `Ism` (Status, Number, Gender, Type).
2.  **Sentence Structures (`Nahw`):** We learned to identify and analyze the two fundamental sentence types: the action-oriented **Verbal Sentence (`الجملة الفعلية`)** and the descriptive **Nominal Sentence (`الجملة الإسمية`)**.
3.  **The System of `I'rāb`:** We delved into the heart of `Nahw` by studying the three grammatical cases, understanding the reasons a noun becomes **`Marfū'`** (Nominative), **`Manṣūb`** (Accusative), or **`Majrūr`** (Genitive).
4.  **Word Formation (`Sarf`):** We explored the richness of `Ilm al-Sarf` by mastering the conjugations for the past, present, and command tenses.
5.  **The Derived Verb Forms:** We unlocked the nuance of the language by studying the ten derived verb forms (`الأبواب`), learning how simple additions like a `shaddah` or a prefix can create new layers of meaning (causation, reciprocity, seeking, etc.).
6.  **The Passive Voice:** We learned how to form the passive voice and understood its grammatical and rhetorical function, focusing on the action rather than the doer.

    end
```

### 4.2 The Path Forward: From Theory to Fluency

The knowledge in this book is theoretical. True mastery comes from application. Here is a structured plan for your next steps.

##### 1. Internalize the Paradigms (`Sarf`)
*   **Action:** Use a spaced repetition system like Anki. Create digital flashcards for the `Sarf` tables (past, present, `Ism Fā'il`, `Maṣdar`) for all ten verb forms.
*   **Goal:** To be able to produce the correct form of a verb without hesitation. When you see the root `ن ص ر` and are asked for the Form X `Ism Fā'il`, `مُسْتَنْصِر` should come to mind instantly.

##### 2. Become an `I'rāb` Analyst (`Nahw`)
*   **Action:** Begin a systematic reading of the Quran, one `juz'` at a time, with the specific goal of grammatical analysis. This is called `تطبيق` (taṭbīq - application).
*   **Process:**
    1.  Take one verse.
    2.  Go through it word by word.
    3.  Identify the type of each word (`Ism`, `Fi'l`, `Harf`).
    4.  For each `Ism`, identify its four properties. State the *reason* for its status (e.g., "This is `Manṣūb` because it is the `Maf'ūl bihi`").
    5.  For each `Fi'l`, identify its form (I, II, IV, etc.) and its tense.
    6.  Check your analysis against a dedicated `I'rāb al-Qur'an` resource (many are available online, such as the "Quranic Arabic Corpus").
*   **Goal:** To be able to look at any verse and create a mental "parse tree," identifying the `Fā'il`, `Maf'ūl`, `Mubtada'`, `Khabar`, etc., automatically.

##### 3. Expand Your Vocabulary
*   **Action:** While doing your `I'rāb` analysis, maintain a vocabulary journal or Anki deck.
*   **Method:** When you encounter a new word, don't just learn its translation. Learn its root and its verb form.
    *   If you learn `الْمُفْلِحُونَ` (the successful ones), note that its root is `ف ل ح` and it is the `Ism Fā'il` of **Form IV** (`أَفْلَحَ` - to grant success). This connects vocabulary to the grammatical system you've learned.

##### 4. Study Balāghah (Rhetoric)
*   **Concept:** Once you understand *what* a sentence says (`Nahw`), the next level is to understand *how* and *why* it says it so beautifully and powerfully. This is the science of `البلاغة` (al-Balāghah - Rhetoric).
*   **Action:** After you are comfortable with `Nahw` and `Sarf`, begin studying a basic text on `Balāghah`. This will explain why a sentence was structured as nominal instead of verbal, why a certain word was placed first, and the deeper meanings behind the grammatical choices.

### 4.3 Final Words

The author of "Umm al-Ulum wa Abuha" provided a key to a locked treasure chest. This book has been our guide to understanding how that key is shaped and how its teeth are cut. The next step is yours: to take this key, walk up to the treasure chest of the Quran, and begin to unlock its inexhaustible wonders for yourself.

**وَاللَّهُ يَقُولُ الْحَقَّ وَهُوَ يَهْدِي السَّبِيلَ**
*And Allah speaks the truth, and He guides to the [right] way.* (Surah Al-Ahzab, 33:4)

Of course. This is the perfect way to conclude the book. A "Grand Synthesis" chapter that provides a high-level, visual overview of everything learned, followed by a clear "Path Forward," will be immensely valuable for the student. It will consolidate their knowledge and give them direction.

Here is the comprehensive revision and future course section, incorporating tables, Mermaid diagrams, and a structured plan.

## 4.0 The Grand Synthesis & The Path Forward

This concluding chapter serves two purposes. First, it provides a high-level, visual summary of the core concepts of `Sarf` and `Nahw` to consolidate your understanding. Second, it lays out a clear, actionable path for you to continue your journey toward mastery of Quranic Arabic.

### 4.1 The Grand Synthesis: A Visual Overview

#### 4.1.1 The Two Sciences of the Arabic Word

At its heart, our entire study has been about the `كلمة` (the word) and the two sciences that govern it. This diagram illustrates their relationship:

    end

    B --> E
    C --> E

    C --> H
    D --> H

```

*   **`Ilm al-Sarf`** is the science of the word itself—how it is formed and transformed.
*   **`Ilm al-Nahw`** is the science of the word's role in a sentence—how it interacts with other words.

#### 4.1.2 Master Verb Form Table (`Sarf` Summary)

This table summarizes the ten derived verb forms, their patterns, and their core functions. It is your primary key for decoding verbs.

| Form | Pattern (`Māḍī`) | `Ism Fā'il` | `Maṣdar` | Core Meaning/Function |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **I** | `فَعَلَ` | `فَاعِل` | *Variable* | Base Meaning |
| **II** | `فَعَّلَ` | `مُفَعِّل` | `تَفْعِيل` | **Causative / Intensive** (to make someone do / to do a lot) |
| **III**| `فَاعَلَ` | `مُفَاعِل` | `مُفَاعَلَة` | **Reciprocal / To/With** (to do an action *to* someone) |
| **IV** | `أَفْعَلَ` | `مُفْعِل` | `إِفْعَال` | **Causative** (to make someone do) |
| **V** | `تَفَعَّلَ` | `مُتَفَعِّل` | `تَفَعُّل` | **Reflexive of Form II** (to have X done to oneself) |
| **VI** | `تَفَاعَلَ` | `مُتَفَاعِل` | `تَفَاعُل` | **Reciprocal** (to do X with each other) |
| **VII**| `اِنْفَعَلَ` | `مُنْفَعِل` | `اِنْفِعَال` | **Passive / Reflexive** (to be done / to do itself) |
| **VIII`| `اِفْتَعَلَ` | `مُفْتَعِل` | `اِفْتِعَال` | **Reflexive / Effort** (to do for oneself / to strive to do) |
| **X** | `اِسْتَفْعَلَ` | `مُسْتَفْعِل` | `اِسْتِفْعَال` | **To Seek / Ask For** |

#### 4.1.4 Master `I'rāb` Signs Table

This reference table shows the *signs* (endings) for each case based on the noun's number. This is one of the most crucial tables for practical application.

| Status | Singular (`مفرد`) | Dual (`مثنى`) | Sound Masc. Plural (`جمع مذكر سالم`) | Sound Fem. Plural (`جمع مؤنث سالم`) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **`Marfū'`** | `ـُ` / `ـٌ` (dammah) | `ـَانِ` (`-āni`) | `ـُونَ` (`-ūna`) | `ـَاتٌ` (`-ātun`) |
| **`Manṣūb`** | `ـَ` / `ـً` (fathah) | `ـَيْنِ` (`-ayni`) | `ـِينَ` (`-īna`) | **`ـَاتٍ` (`-ātin`)** |
| **`Majrūr`** | `ـِ` / `ـٍ` (kasrah) | `ـَيْنِ` (`-ayni`) | `ـِينَ` (`-īna`) | `ـَاتٍ` (`-ātin`) |

> [!WARNING] Note the two special cases: The `Manṣūb` and `Majrūr` forms are identical for Duals and Sound Masculine Plurals. The Sound Feminine Plural uses a `kasrah` (`ـَاتٍ`) for its `Manṣūb` state.

### 4.2 The Path Forward: From Theory to Fluency

This book has given you the tools. The following steps will help you learn how to use them effectively.

#### Phase 1: Solidify the Foundation (The Next 3-6 Months)

Your immediate goal is to make the knowledge in this book second nature.

1.  **Begin Systematic `Tatbīq` (Application):**
    *   **Action:** Choose a short Surah you know well (e.g., from Juz' Amma). Read it verse by verse with the sole intention of grammatical analysis.
    *   **Process:** For each verse, identify the sentence types, the `Fā'il`, the `Maf'ūl`, the `Iḍāfah` constructions, the verb forms, etc. Write down your analysis.
    *   **Verification:** Use an online resource like the "Quranic Arabic Corpus" to check your work. This feedback loop is essential.

2.  **Internalize the Paradigms:**
    *   **Action:** Create Anki flashcards for the **Master Verb Form Table** above. You should be able to see a root and a form number and instantly know its key patterns.
    *   **Goal:** Achieve automaticity. The patterns should become as natural as basic arithmetic.

3.  **Build a Root-Based Vocabulary:**
    *   **Action:** As you read, create vocabulary flashcards. Crucially, don't just learn that `مَغْفِرَة` means "forgiveness." Note that it is the `Maṣdar` of the root `غ ف ر`.
    *   **Goal:** To see the language as a system of interconnected roots, not a list of disconnected words.

#### Phase 2: Broaden the Horizons (Intermediate Studies)

Once you are comfortable analyzing basic sentences, you can move to the next level of appreciation.

1.  **Study `Ilm al-Balāghah` (Rhetoric):**
    *   **What it is:** The science of literary beauty and effectiveness. It answers *why* a certain grammatical structure was chosen over another. Why was the sentence nominal instead of verbal? Why was the object placed before the verb?
    *   **Action:** Find a basic English or Urdu introduction to `Balāghah` (covering `Ma'ānī`, `Bayān`, and `Badī'`). This will transform your appreciation of the Quran's linguistic miracle.

2.  **Engage with a Simple `Tafsīr`:**
    *   **Action:** Begin reading a `Tafsīr` (exegesis) that focuses on linguistic and grammatical points. This will show you how scholars have applied these very rules for centuries to derive meaning.

#### Phase 3: Towards Mastery (Lifelong Journey)

1.  **Read Extensively:** Move on to reading Hadith collections (like `Riyāḍ al-Ṣāliḥīn`) and other classical Arabic texts. The goal is to transition from conscious analysis to subconscious comprehension.
2.  **Develop Listening Skills:** Listen to lectures and talks in Arabic. This will help you connect the grammatical rules to the sound and flow of the language.

### 4.3 Final Words
